			<li>To develop a range of key skills in the student and to offer an early taste of teaching to those interested in pursuing it as a career or for other career pathways where public understanding of science is required.</li>
			<li>To help students gain confidence in communicating Computer Science, develop strong organisational and interpersonal skills, and understand how to address the needs of individuals.</li>
			<li>To learn to devise and develop Computer Science projects and teaching methods appropriate to engage the relevant age group they are working with.</li>
			<li>To help inspire a new generation of Computer Scientists as prospective undergraduates by providing role models for school pupils.</li>
			<li>To help teachers convey the excitement of their subject to pupils by showing them the long-term applications of school studies, especially the cross disciplinary relationships of Computer Science.</li>
			<li>To help teachers by providing an assistant who can work with and support pupils at any point on the ability spectrum.</li>
		<h2>content</h2>
			<li>A competitive interview system will be used to match students with appropriate schools and a specific teacher in the local area, and each student selected will be given a chance to visit the school they will be working in before commencement of the placement.  </li>
			<li>One day training course on working in schools and with pupils.  </li>
			<li>Series of lectures on key transferable skills.  </li>
			<li>The student will be required to spend half a day (approx 4hrs) a week in the school every week for at least 10 weeks.  </li>
			<li>Tutorials which will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences.  </li>
			<li>The students will be involved in the following activities in support of their learning and teaching:  </li>
			<li>Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, observing the level being taught and the structure of the lesson, and offering practical support to the teacher.  </li>
			<li>Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the student with actual teaching tasks, which will vary dependent on specific needs and the student's own ability as it develops over the term. This could include for example offering problem-solving coaching to a smaller group of higher ability pupils, or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class. The student will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of the knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.  </li>
			<li>Whole class teaching: Students will typically be offered, in collaboration with their teachers, at least one opportunity to undertake whole class teaching, albeit that it may be only for a small part of the lesson.  </li>
			<li>University awareness: Students will represent and promote their academic discipline as a potential university choice to pupils across the social and academic range represented at their partner schools.  </li>
			<li>Special projects: The student will devise a special Computer Science project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and module co-ordinator and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with. The student will implement the special project and evaluate it. The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basis 'tests' where appropriate.  </li>
			<li>Extra-curricular projects: The student may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity, such as a lunchtime club or special coaching periods for higher ability pupils. The student will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.  </li>
			<li>Written reports: The student will keep a journal of their own progress in working in the classroom environment, and they will be asked to prepare a written report on the special project.  </li>
			<li>The teachers will act as the main source of guidance in the schools but, in addition, the students will also be able to discuss progress with the module co-ordinator or a member of the Science Outreach and Engagement Team whenever necessary.</li>

- linguistic representations: productivity and reuse<br>
- Connectionist and Bayesian models of language <br>
- language acquisition: speech segmentation and word learning<br>
- categorization and models of word meaning <br>

Edinburgh_Scotland,cxinfr10059,"<h2>Edinburgh_Scotland cxinfr10059</h2><h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science (INFR10059)<h2>summary</h2>This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the theory of computer science, which include some of the greatest intellectual advances of the last century: what does `computing' mean? Are all `computers' basically the same? Can we tell whether our programs are `correct' - and what does `correct' mean, anyway? Can we solve problems in reasonable time, and can we tell whether we can?<br>
The course concentrates primarily on conceptual understanding, but adds enough detail to allow students to go on to further courses, and illustrates how the fundamental concepts are reflected throughout the discipline.<br>
<br>
<h2>content</h2>
    
    The first section of the course asks the question, what does it mean to compute? We start with the finite automata introduced in earlier years, and then generalise to pushdown automata, and show that they have more power. Next we generalize further to very simple abstract general computers, and argue they can do everything real computers can do. We then ask, can we solve every computational question? The answer, with which Turing shocked the mathematicians of the 1930s, is ""no"", with a remarkably easy but beautiful argument (introduced at the end of Inf2-IADS). We then explore some different, but always equivalent, ways of defining ""a computer"". We finish the section by asking how we can compare the difficulty of different problems, and introduce the idea of ""reduction"" as a way of compiling one problem into another. Technically, this covers register machines, undecidability, Turing machines, and reductions.<br>
<br>
The second section thinks about how hard it is to solve solvable problems, leading to one of the most important problems in all mathematics, and the foundation of internet security. We start by reprising Inf2-IADS analysis of algorithms, and then discuss the idea of classifying problems as `tractable' (easy) or `intractable' (hard). We find that the idea of algorithms whose running time grows polynomially in the problem size is a good mathematical definition of `tractable', though not always a practical one. After making this more precise, we ask what happens if we're allowed to just check all the possible answers in parallel - does this give us more problem-solving power? The question is made precise by the concept of NP, and we show that there are ""hardest"" such problems, such as the famous Travelling Salesman. Although the question is easy to ask, nobody knows how to answer it. This is P = NP - if you can solve it, you win a million dollars, and fame for as long as civilization lasts.   So far, NP problems are very hard to solve in practice, so we discuss how to deal with them. We finish the section by talking about much harder problems still. Technically, this section covers P, NP, hardness and completeness, Cook's Theorem, P = NP, and the complexity hierarchy above NP.<br>
<br>
The third section takes brief look at a different way of seeing computation. Haskell needn't be seen as a programming language, it can be the computer itself. We'll show how the lambda-calculus (on which Haskell is based) can do all the computing our other models could, and how the halting problem was actually first solved (or rather unsolved) within lambda-calculus.<br>

Students learn to document designs in the Unified Modeling Language, UML, with emphasis on class, sequence and state diagrams and the Object Constraint Language, OCL. We use modern model-driven development tools and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We study criteria that make one design better than another in context and introduce design principles and patterns that capture good practice.<h2>content</h2>
    
    The course begins by placing design and modelling in the context of the various software engineering processes in widespread use today. Via labs, lectures and self-study using readings, videos and formative exercises, it teaches students to produce (initially straightforward) designs and to document them using UML models, both on paper and with an appropriate tool. We discuss the different affordances of these modes and how models may be used (i) purely informally, (ii) as reviewed documentation for designs, and/or (iii) in model-driven development in which models are formal artefacts and code may be generated from them.<br>
<br>
The second part of the course focuses on identifying and producing good designs. What principles should a good object-oriented design follow? We learn some common design patterns and their role in development and learning.<br>
 <br>
Finally we turn to practical model-driven development: how can the cost-benefit ratio of modelling be improved, now and potentially in the future? Students will learn about model transformations, both model-to-model and model-to-text (e.g., code generation) and be introduced to current tools supporting these. We discuss the role of domain specific languages and the integration of model driven development with agile processes. Throughout the course, we identify the deficiencies as well as the benefits of the fast-changing state of the art, aiming to equip students to critically evaluate tools and techniques that become available to them in future.

You will first acquire a working knowledge of digital design, through the Verilog Hardware Description Language, along with a good theoretical grounding in the design of the key components of a microprocessor. You will have an opportunity to learn, both theoretically and practically, how the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture enables computer architects to analyse and optimize microprocessors to maximize performance.

    This new course presents a logical re-factoring of a sub-set of the material previously contained in the UG3 Computer Architecture and Computer Design courses. The aim of this course is to give students a comparatively deep understanding of computer architecture, to an intermediate level, together with a solid understanding of techniques used to design the logical building blocks from which a computer is constructed. We consider an intermediate level in computer architecture to extend up to the point where students have a good understanding of instruction set architecture, single-issue in-order pipelined execution of instructions, superscalar out-of-order execution, and the memory hierarchies required by those processors. Within a processor, we explore the principles and practice of arithmetic and logic unit design, of the caches from which memory hierarchies are constructed, and the memory and logic gate technologies from which computers are constructed. Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture; this informs not only the theoretical topics but also the practical assignments, which always embody some element of the quantitative approach.<br>
<br>
The philosophy of this course is that learning about computer architecture is particularly effective if reinforced by implementing key aspects of processor design, in real hardware when feasible, but also at higher levels of abstraction using simulated systems. This approach has been used very effectively in the previous Computer Design and Computer Architecture courses, and feedback often cites the value placed on the lab exercises by students.<br>

    - An introduction/review of the idea of computational approaches to studying cognition; the mind as information-processing system; Marr's levels of analysis (computational, algorithmic, implementation).<br>
<br>
- The general motivations underlying the computational modelling of cognition, and different kinds of questions that can be answered (e.g., why do cognitive processes behave as they do, or what algorithms might be used to carry out this behaviour? What kinds of information are used, or how is this information processed/integrated over time?)<br>
<br>
- Mechanistic/algorithmic approaches and issues addressed by these approaches: parallel versus serial processing, flow of information, timing effects.<br>
<br>
- Rational/probabilistic approaches and issues addressed by these approaches: adaptation to the environment, behaviour under uncertainty, learning, timing effects.<br>
<br>
- General issues: top-down versus bottom-up processing, online processing, integration of multiple sources of information.<br>
<br>
- Methodology and issues in the development and evaluation of cognitive models: Which psychological data are relevant? What predictions are made by a model? How could these be tested?<br>
<br>
- Modelling techniques: in the assignments, students will experiment with both symbolic (rulebased) and subsymbolic (probabilistic) cognitive models.<br>
<br>
- Example models: in a number of areas we will look at the theories proposed and different ways of modelling them. Areas discussed will include several of the following: language processing, reasoning, memory, high-level vision, categorization.

    - An introduction/review of the idea of computational approaches to studying cognition; the mind as information-processing system; Marr's levels of analysis (computational, algorithmic, implementation).<br>
<br>
- The general motivations underlying the computational modelling of cognition, and different kinds of questions that can be answered (e.g., why do cognitive processes behave as they do, or what algorithms might be used to carry out this behaviour? What kinds of information are used, or how is this information processed/integrated over time?)<br>
<br>
- Mechanistic/algorithmic approaches and issues addressed by these approaches: parallel versus serial processing, flow of information, timing effects.<br>
<br>
- Rational/probabilistic approaches and issues addressed by these approaches: adaptation to the environment, behaviour under uncertainty, learning, timing effects.<br>
<br>
- General issues: top-down versus bottom-up processing, online processing, integration of multiple sources of information.<br>
<br>
- Methodology and issues in the development and evaluation of cognitive models: Which psychological data are relevant? What predictions are made by a model? How could these be tested?<br>
<br>
- Modelling techniques: in the assignments, students will experiment with both symbolic (rulebased) and subsymbolic (probabilistic) cognitive models.<br>
<br>
- Example models: in a number of areas we will look at the theories proposed and different ways of modelling them. Areas discussed will include several of the following: language processing, reasoning, memory, high-level vision, categorization. Specific models will be introduced and analysed with regard to relevant psychological data.

<br>
This course covers some of the linguistic and algorithmic foundations of natural language processing (NLP). It builds on algorithmic and data science concepts developed in second year courses, applying these to NLP problems.  It also equips students for more advanced NLP courses in year 4. The course is strongly empirical, using corpus data to illustrate both core linguistic concepts and algorithms, including language modeling, part of speech tagging, syntactic processing, the syntax-semantics interface, and aspects of semantic and pragmatic processing. The theoretical study of linguistic concepts and the application of algorithms to corpora in the empirical analysis of those concepts will be interleaved throughout the course.<br>

Edinburgh_Scotland,cxinfr10087,"<h2>Edinburgh_Scotland cxinfr10087</h2><h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Automated Reasoning (INFR10087)<h2>summary</h2>**This course replaces the Level 9 Automated Reasoning INFR09042 10 credit course from 2022-23**<br>
<br>
Automated Reasoning covers the theory, implementation and applications of logic-based reasoning via computers. It is one of the oldest subfields of Artificial Intelligence, originating in the mid-1950s when it was first used to reason about propositional logic. Since then, it has been applied to domains ranging from the formalisation of advanced mathematics to the formal verification of software and hardware systems.<br>
<br>
In this course, we take an interactive approach to automated reasoning and explore how the proof assistant Isabelle can work with the user to establish mathematical correctness via a formal but human-friendly proof language. This provides a way of turning logicbased reasoning into a form of programming that can then be used (among other things) to reason about problems in mathematics, e.g. probability theory and multivariate analysis, and industrially-relevant areas e.g. the safety of autonomous systems.<h2>content</h2>
    
    The course starts with an introduction to higher order logic, theorem provers and, more specifically, Isabelle/HOL. This will set the context for the rest of the course in which Isabelle will be the framework for getting hands-on experience about the application of various theoretical concepts.<br>
<br>
Through the lectures and weekly exercises that incorporate practical aspects the students will gain the skills needed to get started with Isabelle and progress to more complex concepts involving both representation and reasoning.<br>
<br>
The second part will look at representation/modelling of concepts in (higher order) logic in details. Axiomatic versus conservative extensions of theories will be covered and mechanisms such as Isabelle locales will be introduced and used. Recursive definitions and inductive notions will be covered too.<br>
<br>
The third part of the course will focus on fundamental notions such as unification and rewriting, within both a first and higher order context. It will look at notions such as termination and use Isabelle's simplifier as the tool for understanding many of the concepts. It will also look at the interplay between (fully) automatic and interactive proofs.<br>
<br>
The fourth part will introduce declarative/structured proofs and using the Isar language of Isabelle show how proofs resembling pencil and paper ones can be formalized.<br>
<br>
Finally the various strands will be brought together through the discussion of a non-trivial case study. This may involve either formalized mathematics (e.g. looking at a geometric theory) or a formal verification example.<br>
<br>
The assignment will be a combination of basic to intermediate representation and reasoning in Isabelle (up to 40%), more advanced proof tackling one particular domain or example (up to 40%) and a final part which, if completed successfully, will clearly demonstrate that the student has a good grasp of the challenges that advanced interactive theorem proving entails.

Edinburgh_Scotland,cxinfr11129,"<h2>Edinburgh_Scotland cxinfr11129</h2><h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Formal Verification (INFR11129)<h2>summary</h2>Formal verification is the use of mathematical techniques to verify the correctness of various kinds of engineering systems: software systems and digital hardware systems, for example. Formal verification techniques are exhaustive and provide much stronger guarantees of correctness than testing or simulation-based approaches. They are particularly useful for safety and security critical systems and for when system behaviour is highly complex. The course focuses on automated techniques that are currently used in industry. It gives practical exposure to current formal verification tools, explaining the input languages used and introducing the underlying mathematical techniques and algorithms used for automation.<h2>content</h2>
    
    In recent years there have been highly noteworthy cases of the adoption of formal verification (FV) techniques in industry. For example, at Intel, FV has largely replaced simulation-based verification of their microprocessors, at Microsoft, FV is used to certify that 3rd party drivers are free of certain kinds of concurrency bugs. As FV tools and methodologies improve, FV is expected to become more and more widely used in industry. <br>
 <br>
This course aims to familiarise students with main classes of FV techniques that are likely to become most widespread in industry in the coming years. The intent is to prepare students who might go into industry with sufficient background in FV that they would be aware of when and how they might deploy FV techniques. The course will also be of interest to students who wish to go into research developing techniques for future-generation FV tools and who might need to use FV in their research. To satisfy these aims, the course has a practical focus, giving students hands-on experience with a number of tools and explaining their input languages for specifying systems and desired system properties. The course also introduces the underlying mathematical techniques, which gives students a deeper understanding of the tools and will help them use the tools most effectively. <br>
 <br>
Topics the course covers include the following: <br>
*Formal verification in context, its current take-up in industry and challenges to its wider <br>
adoption <br>
*Syntax and semantics of CTL and LTL temporal logics <br>
*CTL and LTL model checking techniques, including automata-based approaches and <br>
bounded model checking with SAT solvers <br>
*The BDD data-structure used at the heart of many model checkers <br>
*Writing models for model checking and phrasing useful properties in CTL and LTL <br>
*Operational semantics of a simple imperative programming language, weakest precondition <br>
operators and verification condition generation <br>
*The capabilities of SMT solvers for discharging verification conditions <br>
*Assertion-based software verification <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Optional topics include: <br>
*Industrial temporal logics such as PSL and SVA used in hardware verification <br>
*Formal verification case studies <br>
*Formal verification of hybrid systems, system with both discrete state changes and <br>
continuous state changes governed by differential equations <br>

Edinburgh_Scotland,cxinfr11187,"<h2>Edinburgh_Scotland cxinfr11187</h2><h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Quantum Cyber Security (INFR11187)<h2>summary</h2>In this course we cover a broad range of effects that the development of quantum technologies bring on the security and privacy of communication and computation. In particular we consider (i) post-quantum security: security of classical protocols when the adversaries have access to quantum computers or other quantum technologies and (ii) quantumly-enhanced security: when quantum technologies are used by honest parties to achieve better (in terms of security or efficiency) performance. We give an overview of the field, while in each case we focus on selected examples to illustrate how to handle security in a world with quantum technologies.<h2>content</h2>
    
    This course deals with the various effects that developing quantum technologies will have on cyber security. Quantum computing and quantum information theory offers new possibilities (in terms of efficiency and security). Here we examine both the extra attacks that adversaries equipped with quantum technologies can perform and the extra possibilities opened when honest parties use quantum technologies.<br>
<br>
The students first will be introduced to quantum information concepts (qubits, mixed states, operations, distance measures) as well as quantum algorithms (factoring, discrete logarithms, search) and their limitations. This will lead to LO1, namely learn the mathematical machinery and the power (and limitations) of quantum information and computation, in view of using these for cyber security.<br>
<br>
The second part consists of learning and understanding quantum cryptography and specifically ""quantum-key-distribution"" protocols, including their security proofs and the how different implementations affect the performance (see LO4). The limitations (practical and theoretical) of quantum cryptography will also be analysed here (including impossibility results).<br>
<br>
The third part deals with generalising classical notions such as encryption, authentication and secure delegated computation to quantum information. Introducing students in these concepts prepares them for the next generation of quantum cyber security that is bound to become relevant when large(r) quantum computers are constructed (LO5).<br>
<br>
Finally, the last part of the course focuses on classical protocols and their security under quantum attacks. A cryptosystem based on the learning-with-errors problems will be introduced as a (key) example of this possibility (LO2). Furthermore, general quantum attacks (superposition attacks, the quantum random oracle model, etc) will be introduced and students will learn to analyse general quantum attacks on a given classical protocol (LO3).

Edinburgh_Scotland,cxinfr11208,"<h2>Edinburgh_Scotland cxinfr11208</h2><h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Security Engineering (INFR11208)<h2>summary</h2>This course aims to give students a thorough understanding of how to engineer security in modern systems. We discuss threat actors from nation states through cybercrime gangs to abuse by family members. We dive into detailed case studies of applications such as payment networks and vehicle systems. We analyse the protection mechanisms of platforms they rely on, such as smartcards, mobile phones and cloud systems. We work through multiple perspectives: classical systems engineering, the psychology of users good and bad, and the incentives facing different actors in the system. This enables students to take a holistic view of security as an emergent property of complex systems, and of related properties such as safety, and to understand how to manage them as systems and their environments evolve.<h2>content</h2>
    
    As ever more devices participate in online systems that become ever more complex, it is ever more important,and more difficult, to manage emergent properties such as security, safety and sustainability. Security engineering is not just about individual mechanisms such as cryptography and access controls but how they work together at scale in real systems. This course will illustrate how to analyse threats and hazards systematically, evolve security policies, integrate them with safety policies and accounting standards as need be, test and certify the resulting systems, and manage their evolution as vulnerabilities are discovered or as their requirements change over time.<br>
<br>
Over the course of 15 lectures we will study how real systems are attacked by a variety of opponents and how their defences evolve to cope. We will look in detail at important applications such as payments, home automation and vehicles. We will look at the psychology of secure design: how we can minimise the risk of attacks involving deception. We will analyse the economics of security: when service providers have adequate incentives to prevent fraud, and where market failure or poor regulation get in the way. <br>
<br>
We will take a deep dive into the protection mechanisms of the underlying platforms, from smartcards through mobile phones to containers, and at whole ecosystems such as phone apps, cloud services and network security. By the end of the course, students should be able to analyse a security problem across the entire systems stack, from the threats and protection goals down through the application and the platforms and if need be to the hardware. They should also appreciate how security interacts with related emergent properties such as safety and sustainability.

Edinburgh_Scotland,cxinfr11213,"<h2>Edinburgh_Scotland cxinfr11213</h2><h2>title</h2>Postgraduate Course: Advanced Robotics (INFR11213)<h2>summary</h2>***This course replaces Robotics: Science and Systems (INFR11092)***<br>
<br>
Robotics is about turning high level goals into plans for action, i.e. robots sense the environment and produce physical motions and interactions with the environment to achieve a goal. In this course, stu-dents will learn the major algorithmic techniques and practical skills in robotics that can be applied and transferred to many real-world applications, such as manipulation of surgical robotics and robot as-sembly in automobile and manufacturing. <br>
<br>
The course assumes no prior knowledge of robotics, so begins with a high-level overview of the major areas in robotics and then introduces core topics: kinematics, dynamics and control; state estimation and signal processing; digital control systems; optimisation and optimal control; robot motion planning and basics of robot learning. <br>
<br>
Building on these fundamentals, the course then focuses on the advanced control and task planning of articulated robotic systems, e.g. robotic manipulators. Students develop a lab practical in both simulation and on a real robot, so as to consolidate theoretical knowledge and develop practical skills.<br>
<h2>content</h2>
    
    This is a fast-paced course that starts with the fundamentals and then proceeds to go in-depth with core elements in robotics. The focused topics cover: kinematics, dynamics and control; state estimation and signal processing; digital control systems; optimisation, robot motion planning; and robot learning. <br>
<br>
The aim of the course is to present essentials in robotics, articulated robots in particular, culminating in a robotic lab practical. The lab involves the development of an integrated robotic system which embodies the major algorithmic techniques used in real-world robotic applications. To bridge the lectures on algorithms and lab sessions, the course also provides tutorials dedicated to the practice of programming and the implementation of algorithms - from the equations to code.<br>
<br>
Lectures on these topics will be complemented by labs that exercise knowledge of a cross section of these techniques, based on realistic tasks driven by real-world applications, such as dual-arm robot manipulation. The practical lab consists of 2 parts: individual-based simulation (80%), and group-based real robot demonstration (20%). The lab demonstration will be carried out on an advanced humanoid robot and students will work in groups to deploy their work on the real robot.

<br>
This course introduces the discipline of Bioinformatics to students from both physical science and life science backgrounds. Bioinformatics is an inter-disciplinary subject that develops and implements novel methodologies and tools for analysing and learning from biological data. These data are increasingly large and complex as a result of significant technological developments and their application at scale in biological and biomedical application areas.<br>
<br>
In this course, we will cover the fundamental domain knowledge needed from both biological and computational disciplines to enable further study and research in this subject with a strong practical and theoretical emphasis to increase understanding. No previous knowledge of Bioinformatics or programming is required.<h2>content</h2>
    
    In this course, we will introduce key biological concepts including the main types of molecules we study (DNA, RNA, and protein) as well as the cell biological processes involved in their regulation and function in biological systems. The cornerstone of foundational Bioinformatics lies in the analysis of sequences; strings of characters that encode genetic information in organisms. We will describe the theory and put into practice how we work with and analyse biological sequences through biological sequence databases, process automation, algorithms and tools to allow pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, as well as approaches using high-throughput next-generation sequence data. <br>
<br>
This course will involve practical work both in workshop/tutorial sessions and in coursework with real biological case-studies and using the Python scripting language. No previous knowledge of Biology or Python scripting is required.

<br>
The overall aim of the course is to describe how reasoning can be modelled using computers. Its more specific aim is to provide a route into more advanced uses of theorem proving in order to solve problems in mathematics and formal verification. <br>
 <br>
Major emphases are on: how knowledge can be represented using propositional, first-order and higher-order logic; how these representations can be used as the basis for reasoning, and how these reasoning processes can be guided to a successful conclusion through a variety of means ranging from fully-automated to interactive ones. Students will develop a thorough understanding of modern, interactive theorem proving via lectures and a practical assignment.<h2>content</h2>
    
    The course starts with an introduction to higher order logic, theorem provers and, more specifically, Isabelle/HOL. This will set the context for the rest of the course in which Isabelle will be the framework for getting hands-on experience about the application of various theoretical concepts. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Through the lectures and weekly exercises that incorporate practical aspects the students will gain the skills needed to get started with Isabelle and progress to more complex concepts involving both representation and reasoning. <br>
 <br>
The second part will look at representation/modelling of concepts in (higher order) logic in details. Axiomatic versus conservative extensions of theories will be covered and mechanisms such as Isabelle locales will be introduced and used. Recursive definitions and inductive notions will be covered too. <br>
 <br>
The third part of the course will focus on fundamental notions such as unification and rewriting, within both a first and higher order context. It will look at notions such as termination and use Isabelle's simplifier as the tool for understanding many of the concepts. It will also look at the interplay between (fully) automatic and interactive proofs. <br>
 <br>
The fourth part will introduce declarative/structured proofs and using the Isar language of Isabelle show how proofs resembling pencil and paper ones can be formalized. <br>
 <br>
Finally the various strands will be brought together through the discussion of a non-trivial case study. <br>
This may involve either formalized mathematics (e.g. looking at a geometric theory) or a formal verification example. <br>
 <br>
The assignment will be a combination of basic to intermediate representation and reasoning in Isabelle (up to 40%), more advanced proof tackling one particular domain or example (up to 40%) and a final part which, if completed successfully, will clearly demonstrate that the student has a good grasp of the challenges that advanced interactive theorem proving entails.

The manual creation of a well-readable drawing, such as the design of a UML diagram with a software engineering tool, can be a very time consuming activity.

This class covers approaches for the efficient, automatic creation of well-readable diagrams. This is an application-driven form of algorithm engineering, where cognitive psychology plays an important role. Graph drawing methods are used increasingly for example in ""auto-layout"" features of development tools.

The tool stretches from theoretical foundations to practical implementations.

The term ""autonomous"" refers to the ability of the system to learn without or with only very limited external support, which includes manual intervention of humans, availability of pre-defined models or expert knowledge, and availability of large sets of sample data. Specific research topics are: Adaptation of the learning models / techniques based on observations, learning from interaction with the environment, re-using knowledge from one domain in another domain, detection of behaviour that deviates from 'usual' or expected behaviour, and learning from and with other systems of the same kind. The lecture gives an introduction to the field of autonomous learning with a particular focus on a utilisation of the different techniques within intelligent systems. Autonomous Learning is cutting edge research, which means that parts of the lecture are based on current research articles rather than on textbooks.

CAU_Germany,inf-CI,"<h2>CAU_Germany inf-CI</h2><h2>title</h2>Computational Intelligence<h2>summary</h2>The term ""Computational Intelligence"" (CI) describes a branch of artificial intelligence. Essentially, it summarizes three biologically motivated areas of information processing: Based on algorithms of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks as well as on the evolutionary algorithms, the mastery of complex systems is sought and combined with other, typically biologically-inspired, processes. Originally coined in the 1990s by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the term is often used synonymously with soft computing nowadays. All included sub-areas have in common that they make mechanisms of natural (i.e. in particular biological, physical or social) problem-solving strategies usable for mathematical or engineering-technical issues. This is not aimed at a direct transfer or ""technical copy"", but at an understanding and imitation of the basic mechanisms. The procedures developed in this way are in contrast to exact mathematical procedures - one rather freely follows the motto: ""Permitted is what works"".

UOC_Spain,5.576,"<h2>UOC_Spain 05.576</h2><h2>title</h2>Computer networks design<h2>summary</h2>Today, large networks are a fundamental part of our environment, mainly thanks to the Internet phenomenon and the proliferation of broadband. From email or instant messaging to web services, networks are one more aspect of our lives, always present invisibly, but now unavoidable. For this reason, new specialists are needed every day to support companies that want to get the most out of their networks and use remote interconnection technologies to make the distance that separates them disappear completely. This need has also created a set of professional certifications attesting to their expertise.

The ""Design of Computer Networks"" (DRC) course uses the basics of network design as a narrative thread to train students in two important aspects of network deployment in multi-branch organizations. On the one hand, the creation of redundant and scalable local area networks (LAN), and on the other hand, the basic mechanisms to achieve connectivity through different WAN technologies (Wide Area Network, Wide Area Networks).

Its main particularity compared to other degree subjects is that its content is fully aligned with part of the latest version of the official Cisco syllabus for obtaining the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) professional certification, in Spanish. This is one of the most recognized in the world of professional networks and serves as an entry point for a number of specializations in the field (design, security, etc.).

Specifically, within the entire agenda of this latest version of the CCNA agenda, called ""CCNA Routing & Switching"", the first module corresponds to a small part of the ""Scaling Networks"" curriculum and the rest with practically all of ""Connecting networks”. "".<h2>content</h2>Due to the characteristics of the subject, the materials that will be used throughout the DXC course are the official ones for the CCNA certification, provided within the official Cisco Systems training program, called ""Networking Academy"".

The contents are located within the object-oriented methodology, the most currently accepted, and using the UML notation for the same reason.

Patterns (analysis, design, architecture...) are one of the innovations that have had the greatest impact in object-oriented development in recent years, along with the appearance of the UML language. Their main advantage is that they save time and improve quality by applying solutions (which we call patterns) that have already been widely tested by other designers.

For this reason, the use of patterns is considered a basic skill that object-oriented software designers must acquire today. Now, it does not seem that this ability can be acquired in any other way than through practice; In this practice, the detailed information found in books -which are already beginning to be numerous- about patterns is usually used, and this way of working is the one that is recommended to students for their future professional work.

This course provides summary descriptions of many of the most popular and currently accepted patterns, as well as some general concepts about patterns and their usage.<h2>content</h2>The didactic material of the course consists of three didactic modules:

Learning Module 1: Introduction to Patterns

In this module, notions of UML are given with practical examples of the different modeling techniques. Includes an analysis example and a design example.

For this reason, the use of patterns is considered a basic skill that object-oriented software designers must acquire today. Now, it does not seem that this ability can be acquired in any other way than through practice; In this practice, the detailed information found in books -which are already beginning to be numerous- about patterns is usually used, and this way of working is the one that is recommended to students for their future professional work.

This course provides summary descriptions of many of the most popular and currently accepted patterns, as well as some general concepts about patterns and their usage.","The didactic material of the course consists of three didactic modules:

Learning Module 1: Introduction to Patterns

In this module, notions of UML are given with practical examples of the different modeling techniques. Includes an analysis example and a design example.

Didactic module 2: Catalog of patterns

The most significant patterns are discussed and a description of patterns covering practically the entire software life cycle is provided.

Learning Module 3: Pattern Development Case Study

It includes the detailed development of a case study similar to the practice proposed to the students.

The materials of this subject are not designed to be studied in a linear way, but once the introduction (Module 1) has been read, it is recommended to combine the study of theory (Module 2) with practice (Module 3). In the description of each activity, you will find a detailed description of which specific sections of each module must be studied in order to carry out the activity.",

In particular, the relentless increase in the power of personal computers and mobile devices, the lowering of hardware costs, and the appearance of global coverage data networks have made possible an infrastructure that is especially conducive to the use of open and distributed systems. 

These changes have caused, among other things, that the traditional methods of software design and development (seen in the subjects of Engineering and Software Analysis and design with patterns) are insufficient, since, more or less implicitly, they assume that The application to be developed will be executed in a basically centralized environment. Therefore, traditional methods are unable to naturally manage the complexity of the requirements of this new type of systems. On the other hand, the aspects closest to the analysis and specification of requirements studied in the Requirements Engineering subject do not change with respect to what was seen in previous courses and, therefore, are not repeated here.

This subject serves as an introduction to software architectures as a framework for the design and development of distributed applications where the fundamentals, techniques and skills applicable to the modern definition of software architectures are studied and put into practice and knowledge is complemented. acquired in previous courses. The design of the architecture of software systems makes it possible to describe in an abstract and high-level way both the functionality of the system and many other non-functional aspects of it (distribution, reliability, security, adaptability, benefits, etc.). This system description is often defined by an architectural style, a classification of software systems into large families that follow a common structural pattern. Among the most common architectural styles for distributed systems are systems organized into microservices, multiple layers, client-server systems, or peer-to-peer systems.

Application design in terms of software microservices must be further refined to accommodate and implement it on a particular distributed software technology. These architectures can be implemented using any programming paradigm (object-oriented, structured...). In our specific case, the reference language will be Java, which allows the development of distributed applications with microservices architectures. These microservices are the ones that will be used to implement and test the architectural elements described in the system architecture.

Finally, some good practices in the development and production of software in distributed architectures are collected. Some of the key concepts are worked on when developing and putting into production, such as continuous delivery, DevOps culture, and deployment with containers.

UOC_Spain,5.591,"<h2>UOC_Spain 05.591</h2><h2>title</h2>Computer networks structure<h2>summary</h2>Today, large networks are a fundamental part of our environment, mainly thanks to the Internet phenomenon and the proliferation of broadband. From email or instant messaging to web services, networks are one more aspect of our lives, always present invisibly, but now unavoidable. For this reason, new specialists are needed every day to support companies that want to get the most out of their networks and use remote interconnection technologies to make the distance that separates them disappear completely. This need has also created a set of professional certifications attesting to their expertise.

The course ""Computer Network Structure"" (ERC) focuses on learning the fundamentals of the lowest level communication protocols that allow different types of devices to communicate: Transport, Internet and Network Access. Within this, special prominence is given to the operation of Ethernet local area networks (LAN) and the creation of IP addressing schemes.

Its main particularity compared to other degree subjects is that its content is fully aligned with part of the latest version of the official Cisco syllabus for obtaining the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) professional certification, in Spanish. This is one of the most recognized in the professional world of networks and serves as an entry point for a whole set of specializations in the field (design, security, etc.).

Specifically, within the entire agenda of this latest version of the CCNA agenda, this course encompasses practically the entire first part of the course, called ""Introduction to Networks"" (ITN), and a part of the second, called ""Switching , Routing and Wireless Fundamentals"" (SRWE).<h2>content</h2>Due to the characteristics of the subject, the materials that will be used throughout the ERC course are the official ones for the CCNA certification, provided within the official Cisco Systems training program, called ""Networking Academy"". These materials are supplemented by the book ""Computer Networks: A Top-Down Approach,"" which is not part of the curriculum for this certification.

The course syllabus within the subject is divided into four thematic blocks, or modules, which include the different chapters of the materials from the parts ""Introduction to Networks"", ""Essential Switching, Routing and Wireless"", and some sections of the book .

Requirements engineering takes place in the same context as software engineering (software development), so it can be seen as part of software engineering. Even so, it must be taken into account that requirements engineering requires knowledge and skills from other disciplines such as psychology, marketing or design.

The purpose of this course is for future software engineers to deepen their study of the problems, techniques, and tools related to obtaining, managing, documenting, and validating/verifying the requirements of a software system. When presenting the contents of this course, we have set ourselves two main objectives:

1) The discipline of requirements engineering is presented from a practical point of view, giving great importance to the techniques and tools that students will be able to apply in their professional lives.
2) The broadest possible vision of requirements engineering is also given, looking at aspects as diverse as product management or the implementation of automated acceptance tests.

This approach allows establishing conclusions and interpretations whose purpose is to understand the efficient use of ICT in management and business decision making.

The course is based on solving a case throughout the semester by working in interdisciplinary groups. The students of the Degrees in Computer Engineering (GII) and Business Administration and Management (ADE) will share a work space in which they will develop the activities of the subject. This point is very important and the student should consider it before enrolling. Unlike other subjects where there is detailed material to work on for further assessment, the USIO does not have material that the student must study in the classical sense. A group must be formed and work must be done on the approach of a case with contents of business information systems. The development must be collaborative and although some recommended readings are given, searches on the Internet or other sources must also be carried out, proposing a coherent and argued solution. It is not possible to think that there is ""the solution"" in the style of a mathematical exercise, there are several possible ones and the consultant will evaluate the different alternatives with pre-established criteria (indicated as part of the statement).

In increasingly complex environments, information and technology management represents a key aspect for the success and proper functioning of any type of organization, whether private companies or public administrations.

This is a relatively new discipline, both in academic theory and research, and in professional practice. The concept of CIO (the chief executive officer responsible for company information and technology) appeared in the early 1980s and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) was established in 1994.

Information systems management involves the design, effective delivery, use, and impact of information technology within organizations and on society. In the words of Keen (1987), the main focus of this course is the improvement of management design and practice (""management""), in its broadest sense; After all, ""IT management is all about management"" (Austin & Nolan, 2010).

The above definitions describe the hybrid nature of this topic. Technology is not an artifact outside of its use in companies, organizations and human beings. Information systems are not only design, programming or architecture, but above all their effective implementation. And its management is not just about tactics and techniques (improving the organization and processes of the IT department), but about strategy (the relationship with the business strategy and obtaining competitive advantages). For this reason, when we say ""strategic management"", we want to emphasize the more proactive and transformative role that information and technologies have for the company and the need to align information and technology systems with the strategy of the company as a whole. In addition, the volume and relevance of IT spending is increasingly on the agenda of CEOs and the steering committee of companies and organizations.

This course is designed to provide students of the Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and other programs with an introductory overview of the issues currently facing business and technology and the relationship between the two and, in particular, the role of the chief executive officer responsible for systems. and technologies:

What are the main strategic decisions in information systems and how should they be considered and adopted?
How should ICT be directed so that they are correctly aligned with the global business strategy?
How can you ensure more productive relationships between IT departments and other departments and business units?
What are the main contributions of information systems to support, transform and create new products, processes and even businesses?
How information and knowledge management is transforming the way of doing business and the role of IT?
How can IT planning provide a framework and roadmap for meeting the company's mission and vision? How can it be implanted?
How can the IT organization be transformed with a strategic sense?

Additionally, currently there is talk of ""digital transformation"", the process by which organizations have to redesign their products and services, their work processes and their relationship with customers, suppliers, partners and staff due to the irruption of the internet, mobility, cloud and big data. The director of organization and information technology (CIO, or Chief Information Officer) assumes a new role as leader, or at least, prominent partner in this transformation and there is also a greater approach of users and business managers to technologies of the information.<h2>content</h2>The learning units are the following:

UOC_Spain,5.601,"<h2>UOC_Spain 05.601</h2><h2>title</h2>Cryptography<h2>summary</h2>The main objective of the Cryptography course is to train students in the field of modern cryptography. This discipline is increasingly important in the world we live in due to the increasing value of information. On the one hand, cryptographic techniques are necessary to protect the security and privacy of users when using technology and communication networks. In particular, it is important to protect users from mass surveillance activities that can be carried out illegally not only by private companies but also by some government agencies operating outside of legal circuits. On the other hand, beyond the protection of users, companies and any entity that is related to or uses technology needs mechanisms that protect their digital assets, which can sometimes be all the assets of a company. Finally, the development of cryptography also allows the birth of new relationship paradigms between people such as the creation of new virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, which do not depend on any centralized entity to function.

The subject wants to give a practical approach to cryptography, and that is why the subject is structured jointly based on both theoretical and practical content that is complemented by programming activities that allow us to know the real problems that arise in the implementation of cryptographic systems.<h2>content</h2>The contents of the subject are detailed below, grouping the different modules that make it up into thematic blocks:

UOC_Spain,5.604,"<h2>UOC_Spain 05.604</h2><h2>title</h2>Electronic commerce<h2>summary</h2>The Electronic Commerce subject aims to train students in this new discipline born as a result of widely used communication networks, such as the Internet. Despite the wide range of disciplines that are often included in the words ""e-commerce"" (new economics, marketing, law, social behavior, etc.), it is important to note that since we are dealing with a computer engineering subject, its approach is eminently technological. In any case, the fact that its focus is technological does not mean that it includes different disciplines within this aspect. Thus, we can identify three large areas of knowledge that we will focus on in this course.

On the one hand we find the databases. In electronic commerce systems, the correct design and management of databases is extremely important since one of the characteristics of electronic commerce is its high degree of automation, more than in other areas. This makes databases play a very important role.

Another relevant point in electronic commerce is presented by payment systems. As is well known, one of the reluctances that electronic commerce must overcome is distrust and therefore special emphasis must be placed on security.

Finally, there is a part that is often forgotten, perhaps because it affects us little, or rather, it affects us positively, and that is the problem presented by electronic commerce of digital products. The ease of copying together with the precision of these implies that piracy becomes an inherent problem with this support. This problem, which often slows down the sale and distribution of products through electronic commerce, currently generates significant research efforts. We will see different possibilities to end piracy and what problems they present.

The subject wants to be taught with a very practical approach, and that is why two compulsory practices have been included in the subject, in addition to the four PEC. In the first practice we will work with the basic web development technologies to launch an electronic commerce.

UOC_Spain,5.607,"<h2>UOC_Spain 05.607</h2><h2>title</h2>Databases architecture<h2>summary</h2>Database Architecture is an optional subject, proposed within the Information Technologies itinerary, belonging to the Degree in Computer Engineering. The subject delves into the knowledge acquired in previous compulsory subjects on databases, such as the Use of Databases and Database Design.

The course begins by studying the main drawbacks of the relational model and presents some alternative data models. Next, the main problems related to the implementation of database management systems (DBMS) are analyzed, both in centralized and distributed environments. Finally, fundamental concepts on the design of distributed databases are introduced.

The Degree in Computer Engineering has as a transversal competence to acquire the learning of foreign languages ​​(specifically English). That is why some subjects have the learning material in English. This is the case of Database Architecture, given its specific characteristics (specialization subject with a model based on continuous evaluation).<h2>content</h2>The objective of this course, as explained in the first module, is to first introduce the architecture of centralized Database Management Systems (DBMS), to evolve towards distributed systems, identifying the main differences.

In the second module, the limitations of the relational model will be presented to introduce the use of objects and semi-structured data, giving special relevance to the Object-Relational and XML extensions. First, the main features of standard SQL will be covered (for example, large objects, user-defined types, inheritance, references, and multivalued attributes). Next, XML standards such as XSchema, XPath, and XQuery will be covered.

Distributed databases will be introduced in the third module. First, a classification of distributed databases will be explained. Next, depending on whether the distribution is desired or imposed, it will be explained how to approach the design or the integration. The design is related to the sharding of the databases (for example, horizontal, vertical, or hybrid), while the integration can be implemented as a global view, local view, peer-to-peer, or based on containers or interfaces.

Module four addresses aspects of computer security in databases, addressing the three key aspects of this concept: confidentiality, integrity and availability. Aspects such as access control, application access, vulnerabilities, inference mechanisms and auditing will be covered. Emphasis will be placed on different access control systems, as well as role-based access. Aspects related to advanced data management systems will also be worked on and aspects of access control for XML will be dealt with.

Within the fifth module, the concept of transaction explained in previous topics will be deepened. Based on this concept, a distinction will be made between ACID and BASE transactions. Multilevel reservations, the multiversion mechanism and time stamping will be explained. The first two mechanisms have been chosen for their wide use in commercial DBMSs, while the last one has been chosen for its wide use in distributed environments.

The sixth module introduces concepts related to data recovery, which in turn are related to transactions.

Finally, in the seventh module, concepts related to query optimization in distributed environments will be explained. First of all, we will analyze the syntactic optimization to continue working with the physical optimization. The concepts of intra and interparallelism will also be worked on.",Databases architecture,"Database Architecture is an optional subject, proposed within the Information Technologies itinerary, belonging to the Degree in Computer Engineering.
