"Compilers","<h2>title</h2>Compilers<h2>summary</h2>Compilers are essential tools for any computer scientist, responsible for translating textual information from one format or language to another. For example, they act as key players in the execution process of a program: they translate the program from the high-level language used by humans into a low-level language that can be executed on a computer (such as assembler or machine code).This course introduces the basic structure of a compiler: the modules that make it up and how they communicate with each other. We will focus on the case of general purpose programming languages ​​and on the process of generating an executable from a high level program.Specifically, we will see how a source program is analyzed to obtain its components and possible errors introduced by the programmer are detected. The concept of interpreter and its relationship with compilers will also be introduced. Subsequently, it will be studied how the object code is generated and optimized from the data obtained in the analysis part to improve performance. All of this will be implemented by using compiler build tools. ",,5.58,"UOC_Spain","Compilers",,"FPL","FPL","OS; AR",,,,,,

"Requirements engineering","<h2>title</h2>Requirements engineering<h2>summary</h2>Requirements engineering is the discipline that helps us to identify, manage and maintain the set of software requirements that we want to develop. Requirements engineering takes place in the same context as software engineering (software development), so it can be seen as part of software engineering. Even so, it must be taken into account that requirements engineering requires knowledge and skills from other disciplines such as psychology, marketing or design.The purpose of this course is for future software engineers to deepen their study of the problems, techniques, and tools related to obtaining, managing, documenting, and validating/verifying the requirements of a software system. When presenting the contents of this course, we have set ourselves two main objectives:1) The discipline of requirements engineering is presented from a practical point of view, giving great importance to the techniques and tools that students will be able to apply in their professional lives.2) The broadest possible vision of requirements engineering is also given, looking at aspects as diverse as product management or the implementation of automated acceptance tests.This subject assumes that the student has basic notions of requirements engineering (in the case of UOC students, it will be assumed that they have taken the Software Engineering subject). Therefore, this course deepens and extends some concepts that have already been studied before, at the same time that it introduces new techniques and tools of requirements engineering.

"Enterpreneurship","<h2>title</h2>Enterpreneurship<h2>summary</h2>New business opportunities appear every day to respond to previously non-existent or unsatisfied needs or to improve the existing offer. In addition, organizations increasingly value having an entrepreneurial organizational culture and encourage people who work to act as entrepreneurs in the same organization. And it has been shown that there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurship and the development of a country or region. Among other characteristics, it contributes to economic growth, is a source of innovation, favors job creation and contributes to social cohesion and dynamism.In this sense, the Entrepreneurial Initiative subject aims to promote the entrepreneurial spirit of students from the introduction to the main elements that make up the entrepreneurial process from an applied and practical approach. Firstly, we will introduce ourselves to the entrepreneurial phenomenon, analyzing various typologies and taking into account the gender perspective. Next, we will immerse ourselves in the ideation, validation, modeling and presentation of a viable and sustainable entrepreneurial project (following the sustainable development objectives) developing our capacities for initiative, innovation and teamwork.

"Foundations of information systems","<h2>title</h2>Foundations of information systems<h2>summary</h2>The continuous innovations in information and communication technologies are transforming the corporate business world into new models, new processes and new business needs. This environment has favored the investments of the companies to be more competitive in the current market, allocating a budget to the acquisition, implementation or updating of information systems.In this topic we present the basic concepts of information systems, the types of information systems, the relevance of information systems for companies, what the first information systems were like, how they have evolved and what the systems of the system have to contribute. future. In companiesWe will know the main information system: Enterprise Resource Planning, today also known as basic or traditional.We will see how the incorporation of new functionalities in the evolution of ERP systems gives rise to new collaborative information systems: Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supplier Chain Management (SCM) or Business Intelligence (BI).And a transversal theme to any company information system, its implementation. We will cover the life cycle of an implementation project, the characteristics of its different phases, the problems and what guidelines to follow to obtain a successful implementation.

"Planning and strategic use of IS","<h2>title</h2>Planning and strategic use of IS<h2>summary</h2>The mission of this course is to introduce students of Computer Engineering and other careers to the basics to understand the strategic uses of technology in organizations and the management and strategic planning of information systems. In increasingly complex environments, information and technology management represents a key aspect for the success and proper functioning of any type of organization, whether private companies or public administrations.This is a relatively new discipline, both in academic theory and research, and in professional practice. The concept of CIO (the chief executive officer responsible for company information and technology) appeared in the early 1980s and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) was established in 1994.Information systems management involves the design, effective delivery, use, and impact of information technology within organizations and on society. In the words of Keen (1987), the main focus of this course is the improvement of management design and practice (""management""), in its broadest sense; After all, ""IT management is all about management"" (Austin & Nolan, 2010).The above definitions describe the hybrid nature of this topic. Technology is not an artifact outside of its use in companies, organizations and human beings. Information systems are not only design, programming or architecture, but above all their effective implementation. And its management is not just about tactics and techniques (improving the organization and processes of the IT department), but about strategy (the relationship with the business strategy and obtaining competitive advantages). For this reason, when we say ""strategic management"", we want to emphasize the more proactive and transformative role that information and technologies have for the company and the need to align information and technology systems with the strategy of the company as a whole. In addition, the volume and relevance of IT spending is increasingly on the agenda of CEOs and the steering committee of companies and organizations.This course is designed to provide students of the Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and other programs with an introductory overview of the issues currently facing business and technology and the relationship between the two and, in particular, the role of the chief executive officer responsible for systems. and technologies:What are the main strategic decisions in information systems and how should they be considered and adopted?How should ICT be directed so that they are correctly aligned with the global business strategy?How can you ensure more productive relationships between IT departments and other departments and business units?What are the main contributions of information systems to support, transform and create new products, processes and even businesses?How information and knowledge management is transforming the way of doing business and the role of IT?How can IT planning provide a framework and roadmap for meeting the company's mission and vision? How can it be implanted?How can the IT organization be transformed with a strategic sense?Additionally, currently there is talk of ""digital transformation"", the process by which organizations have to redesign their products and services, their work processes and their relationship with customers, suppliers, partners and staff due to the irruption of the internet, mobility, cloud and big data. The director of organization and information technology (CIO, or Chief Information Officer) assumes a new role as leader, or at least, prominent partner in this transformation and there is also a greater approach of users and business managers to technologies of the information.
