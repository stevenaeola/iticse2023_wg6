In increasingly complex environments, information and technology management represents a key aspect for the success and proper functioning of any type of organization, whether private companies or public administrations.

This is a relatively new discipline, both in academic theory and research, and in professional practice. The concept of CIO (the chief executive officer responsible for company information and technology) appeared in the early 1980s and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) was established in 1994.

Information systems management involves the design, effective delivery, use, and impact of information technology within organizations and on society. In the words of Keen (1987), the main focus of this course is the improvement of management design and practice (""management""), in its broadest sense; After all, ""IT management is all about management"" (Austin & Nolan, 2010).

The above definitions describe the hybrid nature of this topic. Technology is not an artifact outside of its use in companies, organizations and human beings. Information systems are not only design, programming or architecture, but above all their effective implementation. And its management is not just about tactics and techniques (improving the organization and processes of the IT department), but about strategy (the relationship with the business strategy and obtaining competitive advantages). For this reason, when we say ""strategic management"", we want to emphasize the more proactive and transformative role that information and technologies have for the company and the need to align information and technology systems with the strategy of the company as a whole. In addition, the volume and relevance of IT spending is increasingly on the agenda of CEOs and the steering committee of companies and organizations.

This course is designed to provide students of the Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and other programs with an introductory overview of the issues currently facing business and technology and the relationship between the two and, in particular, the role of the chief executive officer responsible for systems. and technologies:

What are the main strategic decisions in information systems and how should they be considered and adopted?
How should ICT be directed so that they are correctly aligned with the global business strategy?
How can you ensure more productive relationships between IT departments and other departments and business units?
What are the main contributions of information systems to support, transform and create new products, processes and even businesses?
How information and knowledge management is transforming the way of doing business and the role of IT?
How can IT planning provide a framework and roadmap for meeting the company's mission and vision? How can it be implanted?
How can the IT organization be transformed with a strategic sense?

Additionally, currently there is talk of ""digital transformation"", the process by which organizations have to redesign their products and services, their work processes and their relationship with customers, suppliers, partners and staff due to the irruption of the internet, mobility, cloud and big data. The director of organization and information technology (CIO, or Chief Information Officer) assumes a new role as leader, or at least, prominent partner in this transformation and there is also a greater approach of users and business managers to technologies of the information.<h2>content</h2>The learning units are the following:

237,UOC_Spain,5.604,"<h2>UOC_Spain 05.604</h2><h2>title</h2>Electronic commerce<h2>summary</h2>The Electronic Commerce subject aims to train students in this new discipline born as a result of widely used communication networks, such as the Internet. Despite the wide range of disciplines that are often included in the words ""e-commerce"" (new economics, marketing, law, social behavior, etc.), it is important to note that since we are dealing with a computer engineering subject, its approach is eminently technological. In any case, the fact that its focus is technological does not mean that it includes different disciplines within this aspect. Thus, we can identify three large areas of knowledge that we will focus on in this course.

On the one hand we find the databases. In electronic commerce systems, the correct design and management of databases is extremely important since one of the characteristics of electronic commerce is its high degree of automation, more than in other areas. This makes databases play a very important role.

Another relevant point in electronic commerce is presented by payment systems. As is well known, one of the reluctances that electronic commerce must overcome is distrust and therefore special emphasis must be placed on security.

Finally, there is a part that is often forgotten, perhaps because it affects us little, or rather, it affects us positively, and that is the problem presented by electronic commerce of digital products. The ease of copying together with the precision of these implies that piracy becomes an inherent problem with this support. This problem, which often slows down the sale and distribution of products through electronic commerce, currently generates significant research efforts. We will see different possibilities to end piracy and what problems they present.

The subject wants to be taught with a very practical approach, and that is why two compulsory practices have been included in the subject, in addition to the four PEC. In the first practice we will work with the basic web development technologies to launch an electronic commerce. On the other hand, in the second practice we will implement an electronic commerce system through a specialized content management tool (CMS) for electronic commerce: Prestashop.<h2>content</h2>The specific contents of the subject that are considered most important are detailed below for each of the modules:

Module 1 - Introduction to electronic commerce (0.5 credits)

Despite the wide range of disciplines that are often included in the words ""e-commerce"" (new economics, marketing, law, social behavior, etc.), it is important to note that since we are dealing with a computer engineering subject, its approach is eminently technological. In any case, the fact that its focus is technological does not mean that it includes different disciplines within this aspect. Thus, we can identify three large areas of knowledge that we will focus on in this course.

On the one hand we find the databases. In electronic commerce systems, the correct design and management of databases is extremely important since one of the characteristics of electronic commerce is its high degree of automation, more than in other areas. This makes databases play a very important role.

Another relevant point in electronic commerce is presented by payment systems. As is well known, one of the reluctances that electronic commerce must overcome is distrust and therefore special emphasis must be placed on security.

Finally, there is a part that is often forgotten, perhaps because it affects us little, or rather, it affects us positively, and that is the problem presented by electronic commerce of digital products. The ease of copying together with the precision of these implies that piracy becomes an inherent problem with this support. This problem, which often slows down the sale and distribution of products through electronic commerce, currently generates significant research efforts. We will see different possibilities to end piracy and what problems they present.

The subject wants to be taught with a very practical approach, and that is why two compulsory practices have been included in the subject, in addition to the four PEC. In the first practice we will work with the basic web development technologies to launch an electronic commerce. On the other hand, in the second practice we will implement an electronic commerce system through a specialized content management tool (CMS) for electronic commerce: Prestashop.","The specific contents of the subject that are considered most important are detailed below for each of the modules:

Module 1 - Introduction to electronic commerce (0.5 credits)

Basic concepts and terminology of electronic commerce.

238,UOC_Spain,5.607,"<h2>UOC_Spain 05.607</h2><h2>title</h2>Databases architecture<h2>summary</h2>Database Architecture is an optional subject, proposed within the Information Technologies itinerary, belonging to the Degree in Computer Engineering. The subject delves into the knowledge acquired in previous compulsory subjects on databases, such as the Use of Databases and Database Design.

The course begins by studying the main drawbacks of the relational model and presents some alternative data models. Next, the main problems related to the implementation of database management systems (DBMS) are analyzed, both in centralized and distributed environments. Finally, fundamental concepts on the design of distributed databases are introduced.

The Degree in Computer Engineering has as a transversal competence to acquire the learning of foreign languages ​​(specifically English). That is why some subjects have the learning material in English. This is the case of Database Architecture, given its specific characteristics (specialization subject with a model based on continuous evaluation).<h2>content</h2>The objective of this course, as explained in the first module, is to first introduce the architecture of centralized Database Management Systems (DBMS), to evolve towards distributed systems, identifying the main differences.

In the second module, the limitations of the relational model will be presented to introduce the use of objects and semi-structured data, giving special relevance to the Object-Relational and XML extensions. First, the main features of standard SQL will be covered (for example, large objects, user-defined types, inheritance, references, and multivalued attributes). Next, XML standards such as XSchema, XPath, and XQuery will be covered.

Distributed databases will be introduced in the third module. First, a classification of distributed databases will be explained. Next, depending on whether the distribution is desired or imposed, it will be explained how to approach the design or the integration. The design is related to the sharding of the databases (for example, horizontal, vertical, or hybrid), while the integration can be implemented as a global view, local view, peer-to-peer, or based on containers or interfaces.

Module four addresses aspects of computer security in databases, addressing the three key aspects of this concept: confidentiality, integrity and availability. Aspects such as access control, application access, vulnerabilities, inference mechanisms and auditing will be covered. Emphasis will be placed on different access control systems, as well as role-based access. Aspects related to advanced data management systems will also be worked on and aspects of access control for XML will be dealt with.

Within the fifth module, the concept of transaction explained in previous topics will be deepened. Based on this concept, a distinction will be made between ACID and BASE transactions. Multilevel reservations, the multiversion mechanism and time stamping will be explained. The first two mechanisms have been chosen for their wide use in commercial DBMSs, while the last one has been chosen for its wide use in distributed environments.

The sixth module introduces concepts related to data recovery, which in turn are related to transactions.

Finally, in the seventh module, concepts related to query optimization in distributed environments will be explained. First of all, we will analyze the syntactic optimization to continue working with the physical optimization. The concepts of intra and interparallelism will also be worked on.",Databases architecture,"Database Architecture is an optional subject, proposed within the Information Technologies itinerary, belonging to the Degree in Computer Engineering.

239,UOC_Spain,5.613,"<h2>UOC_Spain 05.613</h2><h2>title</h2>Data structures design<h2>summary</h2>In this subject the different strategies of data representation in a computer and the criteria to evaluate them are studied. Depending on the type of treatment that has to be done with this information (size, access criteria, etc.), it will be possible to select the strategy that offers an optimal balance between memory consumption and manipulation time.
