You will first acquire a working knowledge of digital design, through the Verilog Hardware Description Language, along with a good theoretical grounding in the design of the key components of a microprocessor. You will have an opportunity to learn, both theoretically and practically, how the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture enables computer architects to analyse and optimize microprocessors to maximize performance. Along the way you will design real hardware, and later in the course you will apply your recently-acquired knowledge of quantitative computer architecture to analyse a simulated system and optimize its performance.<h2>content</h2>        This new course presents a logical re-factoring of a sub-set of the material previously contained in the UG3 Computer Architecture and Computer Design courses. The aim of this course is to give students a comparatively deep understanding of computer architecture, to an intermediate level, together with a solid understanding of techniques used to design the logical building blocks from which a computer is constructed. We consider an intermediate level in computer architecture to extend up to the point where students have a good understanding of instruction set architecture, single-issue in-order pipelined execution of instructions, superscalar out-of-order execution, and the memory hierarchies required by those processors. Within a processor, we explore the principles and practice of arithmetic and logic unit design, of the caches from which memory hierarchies are constructed, and the memory and logic gate technologies from which computers are constructed. Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture; this informs not only the theoretical topics but also the practical assignments, which always embody some element of the quantitative approach.<br><br>The philosophy of this course is that learning about computer architecture is particularly effective if reinforced by implementing key aspects of processor design, in real hardware when feasible, but also at higher levels of abstraction using simulated systems.

39,Undergraduate Course: Security Engineering (INFR11208),"<h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Security Engineering (INFR11208)<h2>summary</h2>This course aims to give students a thorough understanding of how to engineer security in modern systems. We discuss threat actors from nation states through cybercrime gangs to abuse by family members. We dive into detailed case studies of applications such as payment networks and vehicle systems. We analyse the protection mechanisms of platforms they rely on, such as smartcards, mobile phones and cloud systems. We work through multiple perspectives: classical systems engineering, the psychology of users good and bad, and the incentives facing different actors in the system. This enables students to take a holistic view of security as an emergent property of complex systems, and of related properties such as safety, and to understand how to manage them as systems and their environments evolve.<h2>content</h2>        As ever more devices participate in online systems that become ever more complex, it is ever more important,and more difficult, to manage emergent properties such as security, safety and sustainability. Security engineering is not just about individual mechanisms such as cryptography and access controls but how they work together at scale in real systems. This course will illustrate how to analyse threats and hazards systematically, evolve security policies, integrate them with safety policies and accounting standards as need be, test and certify the resulting systems, and manage their evolution as vulnerabilities are discovered or as their requirements change over time.<br><br>Over the course of 15 lectures we will study how real systems are attacked by a variety of opponents and how their defences evolve to cope. We will look in detail at important applications such as payments, home automation and vehicles. We will look at the psychology of secure design: how we can minimise the risk of attacks involving deception. We will analyse the economics of security: when service providers have adequate incentives to prevent fraud, and where market failure or poor regulation get in the way. <br><br>We will take a deep dive into the protection mechanisms of the underlying platforms, from smartcards through mobile phones to containers, and at whole ecosystems such as phone apps, cloud services and network security. By the end of the course, students should be able to analyse a security problem across the entire systems stack, from the threats and protection goals down through the application and the platforms and if need be to the hardware. They should also appreciate how security interacts with related emergent properties such as safety and sustainability.

70,Automatic Graph Drawing,"<h2>title</h2>Automatic Graph Drawing<h2>summary</h2>Graphs are found in numerous areas of computer science and beyond. For example, software engineers make regular use of class diagrams, automata or flow charts. Hardware design makes use of net lists and circuit diagrams. The drawing of a graph is its visual representation. The manual creation of a well-readable drawing, such as the design of a UML diagram with a software engineering tool, can be a very time consuming activity.This class covers approaches for the efficient, automatic creation of well-readable diagrams. This is an application-driven form of algorithm engineering, where cognitive psychology plays an important role. Graph drawing methods are used increasingly for example in ""auto-layout"" features of development tools.The tool stretches from theoretical foundations to practical implementations. We here make use of the Eclipse-based open source tool KIELER (Kiel Integrated Environment for Layout) and the Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK). Both of these projects are developed at the RTSYS research group, ELK is now an official Eclipse project.<h2>content</h2>Foundations of graph theoryAesthetics criteriaTooling, usage of ELK and KIELERDrawing treesForce-based drawingHierarchical graph drawingPlanarization-based graph drawingLabeling approaches<h2>ilo</h2>Properly classify different types of graphs and use correct terminology for graph aspects and propertiesExplain basic graph analyses and their computational complexitySelect and apply suitably algorithmic approaches for the automatic drawing of different types of diagramsExtend existing approaches for specific types of diagramsEvaluate graphs concerning common aesthetics criteriaAfter successful completion of this module students will be able to judge for a given type of graph whether it can be drawn automatically and which algorithmic approaches are suitable. They will also be able to adapt existing drawing algorithms or to develop new approaches. Finally, students should also be able to perform a thesis project (Bachelor or Master) on the subject of graph drawing and to contribute to ELK and KIELER.

72,Computational Intelligence,"<h2>title</h2>Computational Intelligence<h2>summary</h2>The term ""Computational Intelligence"" (CI) describes a branch of artificial intelligence. Essentially, it summarizes three biologically motivated areas of information processing: Based on algorithms of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks as well as on the evolutionary algorithms, the mastery of complex systems is sought and combined with other, typically biologically-inspired, processes. Originally coined in the 1990s by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the term is often used synonymously with soft computing nowadays. All included sub-areas have in common that they make mechanisms of natural (i.e. in particular biological, physical or social) problem-solving strategies usable for mathematical or engineering-technical issues. This is not aimed at a direct transfer or ""technical copy"", but at an understanding and imitation of the basic mechanisms. The procedures developed in this way are in contrast to exact mathematical procedures - one rather freely follows the motto: ""Permitted is what works"".<h2>content</h2>Introduction and organizationComplex systems: definition, environment and mastery of complexityEmergence and self-organizationFractalCellular AutomataEvolutionary algorithmsParticle swarm optimizationAnt algorithmsbee algorithmsNeural networksSummary<h2>ilo</h2>The aim of the event is to provide a first overview of the field of computational intelligence in theory and practice.

119,Software developement project,"<h2>title</h2>Software developement project<h2>summary</h2>The Software Development Project course has as its main objective the development of a specific software project and is based on the practical application of the knowledge and skills obtained so far in the Degree, such as Project Management, Fundamentals of Programming, Engineering of Software, Use of Databases, and specifically the technical skills that were obtained within Software Engineering of Components and Distributed Systems.Despite the fact that the subject is based on carrying out a specific software project, the subject also covers both new theoretical aspects and others that complement the knowledge acquired up to now, such as agile software development methodologies.The effective development of the project will be achieved through a specific agile methodology (Scrum) that iteratively covers in the form of sprints all the stages of the software life cycle, that is, the specification, design, implementation, testing, deployment and delivery of the project. product to the ""supposed"" customer. In particular, in the implementation stage, Java will be used to develop the distributed software based on a microserver architecture. In addition, other technologies will support the project, such as configuration, design, testing, continuous delivery, and containerized deployment tools. All these technologies have been seen and practiced in the previous subject of Software Engineering of Distributed Components and Systems and therefore it is assumed that the students know them.Finally, the complexity of the project will require the specific development of skills related to collaborative work in small groups of students. The UOC will offer students a collaborative space where they can carry out communication between group members, share documentation and, in general, manage the project, with the support and supervision of the subject advisors.<h2>content</h2>Activity 1: ""Agile product development and conceptualization methodologies""Book ""Essential Scrum: A practical guide to the most popular agile process by Kenneth S.

121,Requirements engineering,"<h2>title</h2>Requirements engineering<h2>summary</h2>Requirements engineering is the discipline that helps us to identify, manage and maintain the set of software requirements that we want to develop. Requirements engineering takes place in the same context as software engineering (software development), so it can be seen as part of software engineering. Even so, it must be taken into account that requirements engineering requires knowledge and skills from other disciplines such as psychology, marketing or design.The purpose of this course is for future software engineers to deepen their study of the problems, techniques, and tools related to obtaining, managing, documenting, and validating/verifying the requirements of a software system. When presenting the contents of this course, we have set ourselves two main objectives:1) The discipline of requirements engineering is presented from a practical point of view, giving great importance to the techniques and tools that students will be able to apply in their professional lives.2) The broadest possible vision of requirements engineering is also given, looking at aspects as diverse as product management or the implementation of automated acceptance tests.This subject assumes that the student has basic notions of requirements engineering (in the case of UOC students, it will be assumed that they have taken the Software Engineering subject). Therefore, this course deepens and extends some concepts that have already been studied before, at the same time that it introduces new techniques and tools of requirements engineering.<h2>content</h2>The didactic material of the subject consists of five didactic modules:Module 1: Introduction to Requirements EngineeringIt introduces requirements engineering and presents the practical case that will be developed throughout the rest of the modules.Introduction to requirements engineering.Presentation of the practical caseTypes of requirementsThe requirements engineering process.Use Case RequirementsModule 2: Obtaining requirementsIt reviews the basic requirements elicitation techniques and introduces new techniques.Requirements elicitation techniquesrequirements discoverylegacy solutionsObjectives and requirementscase studyModule 3: Requirements ManagementDescribes new techniques for requirements management, especially from the point of view of managing software as a product.Factors to consider for requirements managementRequirements estimationPrioritization and selection of requirementsManagement of changes in requirements.case studyModule 4: Documentation of requirementsIt shows various styles of requirements documentation and how the different styles have advantages and disadvantages that make them ideal for different situations.Requirements Documentation - OverviewRequirements Documentation StylesDocumentation of requirements through use casesDocumentation of the conceptual model using UML and OCLcase studyModule 5: Validation and verification of requirementsDescribes the process for validating and verifying the correctness of the selected requirements.

122,Foundations of information systems,"<h2>title</h2>Foundations of information systems<h2>summary</h2>The continuous innovations in information and communication technologies are transforming the corporate business world into new models, new processes and new business needs. This environment has favored the investments of the companies to be more competitive in the current market, allocating a budget to the acquisition, implementation or updating of information systems.In this topic we present the basic concepts of information systems, the types of information systems, the relevance of information systems for companies, what the first information systems were like, how they have evolved and what the systems of the system have to contribute. future. In companiesWe will know the main information system: Enterprise Resource Planning, today also known as basic or traditional.We will see how the incorporation of new functionalities in the evolution of ERP systems gives rise to new collaborative information systems: Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supplier Chain Management (SCM) or Business Intelligence (BI).And a transversal theme to any company information system, its implementation. We will cover the life cycle of an implementation project, the characteristics of its different phases, the problems and what guidelines to follow to obtain a successful implementation.<h2>content</h2>The concept of information system is gradually introduced in the different didactic modules: beginning with its definition, presenting the different types of information systems that exist, showing the most important information systems for companies, and ending with a module on how to these systems are implemented. in companies it is managed.The content of the subject is divided into the following didactic modules:Module 0.

123,Planning and strategic use of IS,"<h2>title</h2>Planning and strategic use of IS<h2>summary</h2>The mission of this course is to introduce students of Computer Engineering and other careers to the basics to understand the strategic uses of technology in organizations and the management and strategic planning of information systems. In increasingly complex environments, information and technology management represents a key aspect for the success and proper functioning of any type of organization, whether private companies or public administrations.This is a relatively new discipline, both in academic theory and research, and in professional practice. The concept of CIO (the chief executive officer responsible for company information and technology) appeared in the early 1980s and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) was established in 1994.Information systems management involves the design, effective delivery, use, and impact of information technology within organizations and on society. In the words of Keen (1987), the main focus of this course is the improvement of management design and practice (""management""), in its broadest sense; After all, ""IT management is all about management"" (Austin & Nolan, 2010).The above definitions describe the hybrid nature of this topic. Technology is not an artifact outside of its use in companies, organizations and human beings. Information systems are not only design, programming or architecture, but above all their effective implementation. And its management is not just about tactics and techniques (improving the organization and processes of the IT department), but about strategy (the relationship with the business strategy and obtaining competitive advantages). For this reason, when we say ""strategic management"", we want to emphasize the more proactive and transformative role that information and technologies have for the company and the need to align information and technology systems with the strategy of the company as a whole. In addition, the volume and relevance of IT spending is increasingly on the agenda of CEOs and the steering committee of companies and organizations.This course is designed to provide students of the Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and other programs with an introductory overview of the issues currently facing business and technology and the relationship between the two and, in particular, the role of the chief executive officer responsible for systems. and technologies:What are the main strategic decisions in information systems and how should they be considered and adopted?How should ICT be directed so that they are correctly aligned with the global business strategy?How can you ensure more productive relationships between IT departments and other departments and business units?What are the main contributions of information systems to support, transform and create new products, processes and even businesses?How information and knowledge management is transforming the way of doing business and the role of IT?How can IT planning provide a framework and roadmap for meeting the company's mission and vision? How can it be implanted?How can the IT organization be transformed with a strategic sense?Additionally, currently there is talk of ""digital transformation"", the process by which organizations have to redesign their products and services, their work processes and their relationship with customers, suppliers, partners and staff due to the irruption of the internet, mobility, cloud and big data. The director of organization and information technology (CIO, or Chief Information Officer) assumes a new role as leader, or at least, prominent partner in this transformation and there is also a greater approach of users and business managers to technologies of the information.<h2>content</h2>The learning units are the following:Module 1: Strategic Decisions in Information Systems and Technologies.Module 2: Information Technologies and Business Strategy.Module 3: Information Technologies and Business Processes.Module 4: Information and Knowledge Management.Module 5: Strategic Planning of Information Systems and Technologies.Module 6: Transformation of the information systems management function.We draw attention to the fact that some of these materials may be common to the subject of Strategic Management of Information Systems at the Master's level. At grade level, these competencies are worked on in a different way and with different levels of depth. The teaching guides that will accompany each module or other complementary materials will provide specific instructions on how to carry out an adequate follow-up of the subject.

124,Data structures design,"<h2>title</h2>Data structures design<h2>summary</h2>In this subject the different strategies of data representation in a computer and the criteria to evaluate them are studied. Depending on the type of treatment that has to be done with this information (size, access criteria, etc.), it will be possible to select the strategy that offers an optimal balance between memory consumption and manipulation time.This course is fundamental within the field of programming, since the proper use of data structures is critical in any application that handles large volumes of information or that has very strict efficiency requirements.Previous courses in the field of programming have already introduced some basic data structures, such as lists, stacks, queues, or trees. This subject presents the concept of abstract data type (ATD) as a general model to describe a data structure and study its efficiency. Finally, the core of the course consists of learning to use each data structure properly and knowing how to select the most appropriate data structure for each situation.<h2>content</h2>The subject is structured in eight modules (module 8 of the subjects is not studied):1.

The course illustrates the importance of (i) using a smart representation of knowledge such that it is conducive to efficient reasoning, and (ii) the need for exploiting task constraints for intelligent search and planning. The notion of representing action, space and time is formalized in the context of agents capable of sensing the environment and taking actions that affect the current state. There is also a strong emphasis on the ability to deal with uncertain data in real world scenarios and hence, the planning and reasoning methods are extended to include inference in probabilistic domains.<h2>content</h2>        1.

It is one of the oldest subfields of Artificial Intelligence, originating in the mid-1950s when it was first used to reason about propositional logic. Since then, it has been applied to domains ranging from the formalisation of advanced mathematics to the formal verification of software and hardware systems.<br><br>In this course, we take an interactive approach to automated reasoning and explore how the proof assistant Isabelle can work with the user to establish mathematical correctness via a formal but human-friendly proof language. This provides a way of turning logicbased reasoning into a form of programming that can then be used (among other things) to reason about problems in mathematics, e.g. probability theory and multivariate analysis, and industrially-relevant areas e.g. the safety of autonomous systems.<h2>content</h2>        The course starts with an introduction to higher order logic, theorem provers and, more specifically, Isabelle/HOL. This will set the context for the rest of the course in which Isabelle will be the framework for getting hands-on experience about the application of various theoretical concepts.<br><br>Through the lectures and weekly exercises that incorporate practical aspects the students will gain the skills needed to get started with Isabelle and progress to more complex concepts involving both representation and reasoning.<br><br>The second part will look at representation/modelling of concepts in (higher order) logic in details. Axiomatic versus conservative extensions of theories will be covered and mechanisms such as Isabelle locales will be introduced and used. Recursive definitions and inductive notions will be covered too.<br><br>The third part of the course will focus on fundamental notions such as unification and rewriting, within both a first and higher order context. It will look at notions such as termination and use Isabelle's simplifier as the tool for understanding many of the concepts. It will also look at the interplay between (fully) automatic and interactive proofs.<br><br>The fourth part will introduce declarative/structured proofs and using the Isar language of Isabelle show how proofs resembling pencil and paper ones can be formalized.<br><br>Finally the various strands will be brought together through the discussion of a non-trivial case study. This may involve either formalized mathematics (e.g. looking at a geometric theory) or a formal verification example.<br><br>The assignment will be a combination of basic to intermediate representation and reasoning in Isabelle (up to 40%), more advanced proof tackling one particular domain or example (up to 40%) and a final part which, if completed successfully, will clearly demonstrate that the student has a good grasp of the challenges that advanced interactive theorem proving entails.

Paradoxically, they are among the most permanent features of the computing landscape (Fortran, for example, is still widely used 60 years since its invention), and among the most energetic and innovative, with new programming languages introduced every few months, often aiming to simplify Web programming, parallel, or distributed computing.<br><br>Although few computer scientists will ever design a new, general-purpose language like Java or C++, all computer scientists need the ability to learn new languages quickly, recognise and use (or avoid misusing) common language features, and even design new domain-specific languages for restricted problem domains. The design of programming languages involves many subtle choices and tradeoffs among performance, convenience, and elegance. <br><br>This course covers the essential programming structures for managing data and controlling computation, as well as abstractions that facilitate decomposing large systems into modules.

This course will cover in detail the main language for relational databases, SQL, which is an international standard supported by virtually all systems on the market today. It will also cover the theoretical query languages on which SQL's core is based, namely relational algebra and relational calculus. Other important topics covered during the course include normal forms, transaction processing, concurrency control, incomplete data and rudiments of query optimization. <br><br>Syllabus (core topics)<br>- The relational model and rudiments of SQL<br>- Query languages: relational algebra and calculus<br>- Multisets, grouping and aggregation<br>- Database design: constraints and normal forms<br>- Advanced SQL: nested queries, triggers, null values<br>- Transaction management: concurrent schedules, conflict-serializability, locking<br>- Database access from applications: using SQL in a host programming language<br>- Basics of indexing, query evaluation and optimisation <br><br>Syllabus (advanced topics, if time allows)<br>- Datalog and recursive queries<br>- Incomplete data and certain answers<br> ",cxinfr10080,Edinburgh_UK,Undergraduate Course: Introduction to Databases (INFR10080),,DM,,,,,,,DM,DM,DM,DM
21,Undergraduate Course: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science (INFR10059),"<h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science (INFR10059)<h2>summary</h2>This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the theory of computer science, which include some of the greatest intellectual advances of the last century: what does `computing' mean? Are all `computers' basically the same? Can we tell whether our programs are `correct' - and what does `correct' mean, anyway? Can we solve problems in reasonable time, and can we tell whether we can?<br>The course concentrates primarily on conceptual understanding, but adds enough detail to allow students to go on to further courses, and illustrates how the fundamental concepts are reflected throughout the discipline.<br><br><h2>content</h2>        The first section of the course asks the question, what does it mean to compute? We start with the finite automata introduced in earlier years, and then generalise to pushdown automata, and show that they have more power. Next we generalize further to very simple abstract general computers, and argue they can do everything real computers can do. We then ask, can we solve every computational question? The answer, with which Turing shocked the mathematicians of the 1930s, is ""no"", with a remarkably easy but beautiful argument (introduced at the end of Inf2-IADS). We then explore some different, but always equivalent, ways of defining ""a computer"". We finish the section by asking how we can compare the difficulty of different problems, and introduce the idea of ""reduction"" as a way of compiling one problem into another. Technically, this covers register machines, undecidability, Turing machines, and reductions.<br><br>The second section thinks about how hard it is to solve solvable problems, leading to one of the most important problems in all mathematics, and the foundation of internet security. We start by reprising Inf2-IADS analysis of algorithms, and then discuss the idea of classifying problems as `tractable' (easy) or `intractable' (hard). We find that the idea of algorithms whose running time grows polynomially in the problem size is a good mathematical definition of `tractable', though not always a practical one. After making this more precise, we ask what happens if we're allowed to just check all the possible answers in parallel - does this give us more problem-solving power? The question is made precise by the concept of NP, and we show that there are ""hardest"" such problems, such as the famous Travelling Salesman. Although the question is easy to ask, nobody knows how to answer it. This is P = NP - if you can solve it, you win a million dollars, and fame for as long as civilization lasts.   So far, NP problems are very hard to solve in practice, so we discuss how to deal with them. We finish the section by talking about much harder problems still. Technically, this section covers P, NP, hardness and completeness, Cook's Theorem, P = NP, and the complexity hierarchy above NP.<br><br>The third section takes brief look at a different way of seeing computation. Haskell needn't be seen as a programming language, it can be the computer itself. We'll show how the lambda-calculus (on which Haskell is based) can do all the computing our other models could, and how the halting problem was actually first solved (or rather unsolved) within lambda-calculus.<br> ",cxinfr10059,Edinburgh_UK,Undergraduate Course: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science (INFR10059),,AL; MSF,,,,,,,FPL,SE,AL,AL; MSF

23,Undergraduate Course: Software Design and Modelling (INFR10064),"<h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Software Design and Modelling (INFR10064)<h2>summary</h2>This course introduces the design and modelling of software systems using object-oriented techniques. We start by exploring the use of modelling in software development. Students learn to document designs in the Unified Modeling Language, UML, with emphasis on class, sequence and state diagrams and the Object Constraint Language, OCL. We use modern model-driven development tools and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We study criteria that make one design better than another in context and introduce design principles and patterns that capture good practice.<h2>content</h2>        The course begins by placing design and modelling in the context of the various software engineering processes in widespread use today. Via labs, lectures and self-study using readings, videos and formative exercises, it teaches students to produce (initially straightforward) designs and to document them using UML models, both on paper and with an appropriate tool. We discuss the different affordances of these modes and how models may be used (i) purely informally, (ii) as reviewed documentation for designs, and/or (iii) in model-driven development in which models are formal artefacts and code may be generated from them.<br><br>The second part of the course focuses on identifying and producing good designs. What principles should a good object-oriented design follow? We learn some common design patterns and their role in development and learning.<br> <br>Finally we turn to practical model-driven development: how can the cost-benefit ratio of modelling be improved, now and potentially in the future? Students will learn about model transformations, both model-to-model and model-to-text (e.g., code generation) and be introduced to current tools supporting these. We discuss the role of domain specific languages and the integration of model driven development with agile processes. Throughout the course, we identify the deficiencies as well as the benefits of the fast-changing state of the art, aiming to equip students to critically evaluate tools and techniques that become available to them in future.

For students taking the Informatics Large Practical course we recommend they take the software developed there as their focus.  However, students are free to choose other software projects if they prefer.  The goal is to gain experience of the full spectrum of testing techniques, test planning, testing process and demonstrate that experience on the chosen software project.  <br> <br>Class members will work in groups of 10 and will be encouraged to share experience by providing comment and reviews of others work.  Weekly tutorials will be structured around different aspects of the course and the development of a portfolio describing the work done on the selected software project.<br><br>Each class member will develop an individual portfolio demonstrating they have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.   This will use work on the testing of their chosen software project as evidence, augmented by appropriate other evidence.  Acceptable kinds of evidence demonstrating achievement of the learning outcomes are diverse so part of the assessment is the design of the portfolio in advance of its construction.  There are two or three ""standard"" portfolio<br>designs but class members are encouraged to develop their own approaches that take account of their personal strengths and weaknesses.  Portfolio designs will include specific assessment criteria.   <br><br>Each week there will be a group meeting, around 1-2 hours of recorded material covering the lecture material in the course.  Guest lectures given by a practitioner on their experience of testing in different contexts will illustrate the application of the concepts covered in the course in the development of a real-world product.

34,Undergraduate Course: Formal Verification (INFR11129),"<h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Formal Verification (INFR11129)<h2>summary</h2>Formal verification is the use of mathematical techniques to verify the correctness of various kinds of engineering systems: software systems and digital hardware systems, for example. Formal verification techniques are exhaustive and provide much stronger guarantees of correctness than testing or simulation-based approaches. They are particularly useful for safety and security critical systems and for when system behaviour is highly complex. The course focuses on automated techniques that are currently used in industry. It gives practical exposure to current formal verification tools, explaining the input languages used and introducing the underlying mathematical techniques and algorithms used for automation.<h2>content</h2>        In recent years there have been highly noteworthy cases of the adoption of formal verification (FV) techniques in industry. For example, at Intel, FV has largely replaced simulation-based verification of their microprocessors, at Microsoft, FV is used to certify that 3rd party drivers are free of certain kinds of concurrency bugs. As FV tools and methodologies improve, FV is expected to become more and more widely used in industry. <br> <br>This course aims to familiarise students with main classes of FV techniques that are likely to become most widespread in industry in the coming years. The intent is to prepare students who might go into industry with sufficient background in FV that they would be aware of when and how they might deploy FV techniques. The course will also be of interest to students who wish to go into research developing techniques for future-generation FV tools and who might need to use FV in their research. To satisfy these aims, the course has a practical focus, giving students hands-on experience with a number of tools and explaining their input languages for specifying systems and desired system properties. The course also introduces the underlying mathematical techniques, which gives students a deeper understanding of the tools and will help them use the tools most effectively. <br> <br>Topics the course covers include the following: <br>*Formal verification in context, its current take-up in industry and challenges to its wider <br>adoption <br>*Syntax and semantics of CTL and LTL temporal logics <br>*CTL and LTL model checking techniques, including automata-based approaches and <br>bounded model checking with SAT solvers <br>*The BDD data-structure used at the heart of many model checkers <br>*Writing models for model checking and phrasing useful properties in CTL and LTL <br>*Operational semantics of a simple imperative programming language, weakest precondition <br>operators and verification condition generation <br>*The capabilities of SMT solvers for discharging verification conditions <br>*Assertion-based software verification <br> <br> <br>Optional topics include: <br>*Industrial temporal logics such as PSL and SVA used in hardware verification <br>*Formal verification case studies <br>*Formal verification of hybrid systems, system with both discrete state changes and <br>continuous state changes governed by differential equations <br>*Combining formal and simulation-based verification methods <br>*Dual use of temporal logic properties and assertions in formal and simulation-based <br>verification of hardware and software  <br>*Software model checking, focusing on its use for finding concurrency bugs <br>*Pattern-based detection of concurrency bugs ",cxinfr11129,Edinburgh_UK,Undergraduate Course: Formal Verification (INFR11129),,FPL; MSF,,,,,,,10,SEC; SE,SE; FPL,SE
35,Undergraduate Course: Introduction to Modern Cryptography (INFR11131),"<h2>title</h2>Undergraduate Course: Introduction to Modern Cryptography (INFR11131)<h2>summary</h2>Cryptography is the formal study of the notion of security in information systems. The course will offer an introduction to modern cryptography focusing on models and proofs of security for various basic cryptographic primitives and protocols. Cryptographic proofs are conditional on assumptions that fall in two categories: ""system assumptions"" such as the faithful execution of code, or the availability of private randomness and ""computational assumptions"". The latter are related to the computational complexity of various problems (including factoring large numbers and others). Students will learn to model security problems and prove them secure under precisely formulated system and computational assumptions.<h2>content</h2>        The course is divided in two parts: Private Key and Public Key. Topics covered in the Private Key part are: classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenere), one-time pad and perfect secrecy, computational secrecy, pseudorandom functions and permutations, CPA security, CCA security and proofs by reduction. The following topics are also briefly discussed: block ciphers, modes of operation, message integrity, hash functions and MACs.

In particular we consider (i) post-quantum security: security of classical protocols when the adversaries have access to quantum computers or other quantum technologies and (ii) quantumly-enhanced security: when quantum technologies are used by honest parties to achieve better (in terms of security or efficiency) performance. We give an overview of the field, while in each case we focus on selected examples to illustrate how to handle security in a world with quantum technologies.<h2>content</h2>        This course deals with the various effects that developing quantum technologies will have on cyber security. Quantum computing and quantum information theory offers new possibilities (in terms of efficiency and security).

This will lead to LO1, namely learn the mathematical machinery and the power (and limitations) of quantum information and computation, in view of using these for cyber security.<br><br>The second part consists of learning and understanding quantum cryptography and specifically ""quantum-key-distribution"" protocols, including their security proofs and the how different implementations affect the performance (see LO4). The limitations (practical and theoretical) of quantum cryptography will also be analysed here (including impossibility results).<br><br>The third part deals with generalising classical notions such as encryption, authentication and secure delegated computation to quantum information. Introducing students in these concepts prepares them for the next generation of quantum cyber security that is bound to become relevant when large(r) quantum computers are constructed (LO5).<br><br>Finally, the last part of the course focuses on classical protocols and their security under quantum attacks.

71,Autonomous Learning,"<h2>title</h2>Autonomous Learning<h2>summary</h2>Autonomous Learning research aims at understanding how autonomous systems can efficiently learn from the interaction with the environment, especially by having an integrated approach to decision making and learning, allowing systems to autonomously decide on actions, representations, hyper-parameters and model structures for the purpose of efficient learning. The term ""autonomous"" refers to the ability of the system to learn without or with only very limited external support, which includes manual intervention of humans, availability of pre-defined models or expert knowledge, and availability of large sets of sample data. Specific research topics are: Adaptation of the learning models / techniques based on observations, learning from interaction with the environment, re-using knowledge from one domain in another domain, detection of behaviour that deviates from 'usual' or expected behaviour, and learning from and with other systems of the same kind. The lecture gives an introduction to the field of autonomous learning with a particular focus on a utilisation of the different techniques within intelligent systems. Autonomous Learning is cutting edge research, which means that parts of the lecture are based on current research articles rather than on textbooks.

108,Computer networks security,"<h2>title</h2>Computer networks security<h2>summary</h2>This course presents the problem of security in computer networks, and more specifically in TCP/IP networks.The structure of this course follows the following model. First, the problem of security in TCP/IP networks is presented. Once we have seen the possible security problems in this type of network, we will focus on the prevention mechanisms that exist, based mainly on information filtering. Subsequently, and assuming that not all TCP/IP network prevention and protection systems are infallible, we will study the different intrusion detection mechanisms that exist. Finally we will highlight the specific protection techniques that exist. Specifically, we will introduce the basic notions of cryptography that will allow us to understand the operation of different mechanisms and applications that allow us to protect ourselves against attacks.The focus of this course assumes that the student already has basic knowledge about the operation of TCP/IP networks and the Unix work environment. Its orientation is eminently practical and implies that the student must dedicate an effort to the installation and configuration of the software, as part of the evaluable objectives of the subject.<h2>content</h2>Introduction to computer securitySafety and riskscomputer attacksDefense and computer securityfirewall systemsTypes of firewall systemsImplementation of security policies through perimeter securityiptablesIntrusion detection systemsCyber ​​defense and intrusion detection toolsManagement of events, alerts and incidentssnortSecurity in the communications layersLink Layer Protection: Wireless NetworksNetwork Layer Protection: IPsecTransport Layer Protection: TLSApplication Layer SecuritySSHVPNsecure emailApart from these contents, basic contents on encryption and authentication are also offered to allow students without knowledge of cryptographic subjects to follow the subject.Finally, in the activities of this subject, different tools are used to reinforce the theoretical knowledge acquired in a practical way.

109,Computer networks design,"<h2>title</h2>Computer networks design<h2>summary</h2>Today, large networks are a fundamental part of our environment, mainly thanks to the Internet phenomenon and the proliferation of broadband. From email or instant messaging to web services, networks are one more aspect of our lives, always present invisibly, but now unavoidable. For this reason, new specialists are needed every day to support companies that want to get the most out of their networks and use remote interconnection technologies to make the distance that separates them disappear completely. This need has also created a set of professional certifications attesting to their expertise.The ""Design of Computer Networks"" (DRC) course uses the basics of network design as a narrative thread to train students in two important aspects of network deployment in multi-branch organizations. On the one hand, the creation of redundant and scalable local area networks (LAN), and on the other hand, the basic mechanisms to achieve connectivity through different WAN technologies (Wide Area Network, Wide Area Networks).Its main particularity compared to other degree subjects is that its content is fully aligned with part of the latest version of the official Cisco syllabus for obtaining the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) professional certification, in Spanish. This is one of the most recognized in the world of professional networks and serves as an entry point for a number of specializations in the field (design, security, etc.).Specifically, within the entire agenda of this latest version of the CCNA agenda, called ""CCNA Routing & Switching"", the first module corresponds to a small part of the ""Scaling Networks"" curriculum and the rest with practically all of ""Connecting networks”.

111,Compilers,"<h2>title</h2>Compilers<h2>summary</h2>Compilers are essential tools for any computer scientist, responsible for translating textual information from one format or language to another. For example, they act as key players in the execution process of a program: they translate the program from the high-level language used by humans into a low-level language that can be executed on a computer (such as assembler or machine code).This course introduces the basic structure of a compiler: the modules that make it up and how they communicate with each other. We will focus on the case of general purpose programming languages ​​and on the process of generating an executable from a high level program.Specifically, we will see how a source program is analyzed to obtain its components and possible errors introduced by the programmer are detected. The concept of interpreter and its relationship with compilers will also be introduced. Subsequently, it will be studied how the object code is generated and optimized from the data obtained in the analysis part to improve performance. All of this will be implemented by using compiler build tools.<h2>content</h2>The subject is structured in six modules:1. General Information1. Languages2. Basic notions3. Structure of a compiler4.

113,Analysis and design with patterns,"<h2>title</h2>Analysis and design with patterns<h2>summary</h2>This course is focused on the study of analysis and design patterns contemplated from a practical perspective. The contents are located within the object-oriented methodology, the most currently accepted, and using the UML notation for the same reason.Patterns (analysis, design, architecture...) are one of the innovations that have had the greatest impact in object-oriented development in recent years, along with the appearance of the UML language. Their main advantage is that they save time and improve quality by applying solutions (which we call patterns) that have already been widely tested by other designers.For this reason, the use of patterns is considered a basic skill that object-oriented software designers must acquire today. Now, it does not seem that this ability can be acquired in any other way than through practice; In this practice, the detailed information found in books -which are already beginning to be numerous- about patterns is usually used, and this way of working is the one that is recommended to students for their future professional work.This course provides summary descriptions of many of the most popular and currently accepted patterns, as well as some general concepts about patterns and their usage.<h2>content</h2>The didactic material of the course consists of three didactic modules:Learning Module 1: Introduction to PatternsIn this module, notions of UML are given with practical examples of the different modeling techniques. Includes an analysis example and a design example.Didactic module 2: Catalog of patternsThe most significant patterns are discussed and a description of patterns covering practically the entire software life cycle is provided.Learning Module 3: Pattern Development Case StudyIt includes the detailed development of a case study similar to the practice proposed to the students.The materials of this subject are not designed to be studied in a linear way, but once the introduction (Module 1) has been read, it is recommended to combine the study of theory (Module 2) with practice (Module 3). In the description of each activity, you will find a detailed description of which specific sections of each module must be studied in order to carry out the activity.

114,Software engineering of components and distributed systems,"<h2>title</h2>Software engineering of components and distributed systems<h2>summary</h2>Ongoing advances in computing and telecommunications are changing the way software is developed. In particular, the relentless increase in the power of personal computers and mobile devices, the lowering of hardware costs, and the appearance of global coverage data networks have made possible an infrastructure that is especially conducive to the use of open and distributed systems. These changes have caused, among other things, that the traditional methods of software design and development (seen in the subjects of Engineering and Software Analysis and design with patterns) are insufficient, since, more or less implicitly, they assume that The application to be developed will be executed in a basically centralized environment. Therefore, traditional methods are unable to naturally manage the complexity of the requirements of this new type of systems. On the other hand, the aspects closest to the analysis and specification of requirements studied in the Requirements Engineering subject do not change with respect to what was seen in previous courses and, therefore, are not repeated here.This subject serves as an introduction to software architectures as a framework for the design and development of distributed applications where the fundamentals, techniques and skills applicable to the modern definition of software architectures are studied and put into practice and knowledge is complemented. acquired in previous courses. The design of the architecture of software systems makes it possible to describe in an abstract and high-level way both the functionality of the system and many other non-functional aspects of it (distribution, reliability, security, adaptability, benefits, etc.). This system description is often defined by an architectural style, a classification of software systems into large families that follow a common structural pattern. Among the most common architectural styles for distributed systems are systems organized into microservices, multiple layers, client-server systems, or peer-to-peer systems.Application design in terms of software microservices must be further refined to accommodate and implement it on a particular distributed software technology. These architectures can be implemented using any programming paradigm (object-oriented, structured...). In our specific case, the reference language will be Java, which allows the development of distributed applications with microservices architectures. These microservices are the ones that will be used to implement and test the architectural elements described in the system architecture.Finally, some good practices in the development and production of software in distributed architectures are collected. Some of the key concepts are worked on when developing and putting into production, such as continuous delivery, DevOps culture, and deployment with containers.<h2>content</h2>The subject is structured into 5 main activities, each one with its specific contents: Activity 1: ""Distributed software architectures: a solution for every problem"" Book ""Fundamentals of Software Architecture"" (Richards & Ford): Chapter 1.

119,Use of information systems in organizations,"<h2>title</h2>Use of information systems in organizations<h2>summary</h2>The subject Use of Information Systems in Organizations (USIO) has a deductive approach; that is, through the study and work of cases, the impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in organizations is analyzed. This approach allows establishing conclusions and interpretations whose purpose is to understand the efficient use of ICT in management and business decision making.The course is based on solving a case throughout the semester by working in interdisciplinary groups. The students of the Degrees in Computer Engineering (GII) and Business Administration and Management (ADE) will share a work space in which they will develop the activities of the subject. This point is very important and the student should consider it before enrolling. Unlike other subjects where there is detailed material to work on for further assessment, the USIO does not have material that the student must study in the classical sense. A group must be formed and work must be done on the approach of a case with contents of business information systems. The development must be collaborative and although some recommended readings are given, searches on the Internet or other sources must also be carried out, proposing a coherent and argued solution. It is not possible to think that there is ""the solution"" in the style of a mathematical exercise, there are several possible ones and the consultant will evaluate the different alternatives with pre-established criteria (indicated as part of the statement). Group work dynamics are usually complex and in this sense it is very important to form a cohesive group that is willing to work from the beginning.<h2>content</h2>Case title: ""PARROT""Affair:The subject Use of Information Systems in Organizations (USIO) is based on the development of a case study. We will focus on the case of LORO. It is intended to be a first approximation to the resolution of technological innovations to which companies must tend so as not to disappear in the future. The question that management teams in any organization must ask themselves is whether current products and services will continue to be marketed in the future. In the case of PARROT, a drone manufacturer, the help of a consultant is being considered to carry out a detailed study in five phases to take advantage of the disruptive technologies that are appearing in the current digital revolution.The topics to be studied in this case are the following:Emerging technologies according to the Gartner Hype Cycle.Digital Twins technology (Digital Twins) applied to an organization.The application of Conversational Intelligence technology to the manufacturing sector and its ethical concerns.Improving an organization's processes through hyperautomation and process miningMetaverse technology applied to a manufacturing organization.The students will be organized in groups to propose a detailed study to PARROT as a consultant.

121,Cryptography,"<h2>title</h2>Cryptography<h2>summary</h2>The main objective of the Cryptography course is to train students in the field of modern cryptography. This discipline is increasingly important in the world we live in due to the increasing value of information. On the one hand, cryptographic techniques are necessary to protect the security and privacy of users when using technology and communication networks. In particular, it is important to protect users from mass surveillance activities that can be carried out illegally not only by private companies but also by some government agencies operating outside of legal circuits. On the other hand, beyond the protection of users, companies and any entity that is related to or uses technology needs mechanisms that protect their digital assets, which can sometimes be all the assets of a company. Finally, the development of cryptography also allows the birth of new relationship paradigms between people such as the creation of new virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, which do not depend on any centralized entity to function.The subject wants to give a practical approach to cryptography, and that is why the subject is structured jointly based on both theoretical and practical content that is complemented by programming activities that allow us to know the real problems that arise in the implementation of cryptographic systems.<h2>content</h2>The contents of the subject are detailed below, grouping the different modules that make it up into thematic blocks:Unit 1: Basic conceptsBasic terminology as well as the historical evolution of cryptography are studied. The most relevant historical cryptosystems are reviewed. The most relevant concepts of modular arithmetic are introduced to have a sufficient mathematical base to understand the cryptosystems and cryptographic protocols that are presented throughout the course. This block includes modules 1 and 2.    Module 1: Introduction to cryptography    Module 2: Mathematical FundamentalsUnit 2: Shared Key CryptographyThe two large families of shared-key cryptosystems are studied: block cipher and flow cipher. For each family, its main properties are characterized and the most relevant cryptosystems are studied. On the other hand, hash functions are defined, focusing on their properties and applications and analyzing in depth one of its most relevant implementations: SHA256. This block includes modules 3 and 4.    Module 3: Symmetric Key Cryptography    Module 4: Hash functionsUnit 3: Public Key CiphersThe characterization of the most important properties of public key cryptosystems is given, emphasizing topics such as key distribution, digital signatures, the combination between public key/symmetric key, as well as relevant aspects of the implementation of public key cryptography. . . Finally, the architecture and protocols associated with public key infrastructures (Public Key Infrastructure, PKI) are studied. This block includes modules 5 and 6.    Module 5: Public Key Cryptography    Module 6: Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)Unit 4: Cryptographic protocolsThe cryptographic primitives described throughout the course are put into practice for the development of cryptographic protocols, such as secret sharing, null-knowledge proofs, unconscious transfer, or secure multipart computing. This block includes module 7.    Module 7: Cryptographic protocols ",5.601,UOC_Spain,Cryptography,,SEC; MSF,,,,,,,NC; SEC,SEC; MSF,SEC,SEC; MSF
122,Electronic commerce,"<h2>title</h2>Electronic commerce<h2>summary</h2>The Electronic Commerce subject aims to train students in this new discipline born as a result of widely used communication networks, such as the Internet. Despite the wide range of disciplines that are often included in the words ""e-commerce"" (new economics, marketing, law, social behavior, etc.), it is important to note that since we are dealing with a computer engineering subject, its approach is eminently technological. In any case, the fact that its focus is technological does not mean that it includes different disciplines within this aspect. Thus, we can identify three large areas of knowledge that we will focus on in this course.On the one hand we find the databases. In electronic commerce systems, the correct design and management of databases is extremely important since one of the characteristics of electronic commerce is its high degree of automation, more than in other areas. This makes databases play a very important role.Another relevant point in electronic commerce is presented by payment systems. As is well known, one of the reluctances that electronic commerce must overcome is distrust and therefore special emphasis must be placed on security.Finally, there is a part that is often forgotten, perhaps because it affects us little, or rather, it affects us positively, and that is the problem presented by electronic commerce of digital products. The ease of copying together with the precision of these implies that piracy becomes an inherent problem with this support. This problem, which often slows down the sale and distribution of products through electronic commerce, currently generates significant research efforts. We will see different possibilities to end piracy and what problems they present.The subject wants to be taught with a very practical approach, and that is why two compulsory practices have been included in the subject, in addition to the four PEC. In the first practice we will work with the basic web development technologies to launch an electronic commerce. On the other hand, in the second practice we will implement an electronic commerce system through a specialized content management tool (CMS) for electronic commerce: Prestashop.<h2>content</h2>The specific contents of the subject that are considered most important are detailed below for each of the modules:Module 1 - Introduction to electronic commerce (0.5 credits)Basic concepts and terminology of electronic commerce.The EDI standard.Legal aspects of electronic commerce.Module 2 - Security in electronic commerce (1 credit)Basic concepts of cryptography and information security.Specific concepts of public key cryptography.Security in electronic commerce: data, payments and products sold.Module 3 - Information Management (0.5 credits)Structure of a database for electronic commerce.Data analysis of an electronic commerce system.Module 4 - Electronic payment systems (1 credit)card paymentsvirtual wallet systemsPayments via SMSdigital moneyModule 5 - Electronic copyright protection systems (1 credit)Basic concepts of copyright protection techniques for content in digital format.Description of a still image marking system.Description of a digital video marking system.

123,Databases architecture,"<h2>title</h2>Databases architecture<h2>summary</h2>Database Architecture is an optional subject, proposed within the Information Technologies itinerary, belonging to the Degree in Computer Engineering. The subject delves into the knowledge acquired in previous compulsory subjects on databases, such as the Use of Databases and Database Design.The course begins by studying the main drawbacks of the relational model and presents some alternative data models. Next, the main problems related to the implementation of database management systems (DBMS) are analyzed, both in centralized and distributed environments. Finally, fundamental concepts on the design of distributed databases are introduced.The Degree in Computer Engineering has as a transversal competence to acquire the learning of foreign languages ​​(specifically English). That is why some subjects have the learning material in English. This is the case of Database Architecture, given its specific characteristics (specialization subject with a model based on continuous evaluation).<h2>content</h2>The objective of this course, as explained in the first module, is to first introduce the architecture of centralized Database Management Systems (DBMS), to evolve towards distributed systems, identifying the main differences.In the second module, the limitations of the relational model will be presented to introduce the use of objects and semi-structured data, giving special relevance to the Object-Relational and XML extensions. First, the main features of standard SQL will be covered (for example, large objects, user-defined types, inheritance, references, and multivalued attributes). Next, XML standards such as XSchema, XPath, and XQuery will be covered.Distributed databases will be introduced in the third module. First, a classification of distributed databases will be explained. Next, depending on whether the distribution is desired or imposed, it will be explained how to approach the design or the integration. The design is related to the sharding of the databases (for example, horizontal, vertical, or hybrid), while the integration can be implemented as a global view, local view, peer-to-peer, or based on containers or interfaces.Module four addresses aspects of computer security in databases, addressing the three key aspects of this concept: confidentiality, integrity and availability. Aspects such as access control, application access, vulnerabilities, inference mechanisms and auditing will be covered. Emphasis will be placed on different access control systems, as well as role-based access. Aspects related to advanced data management systems will also be worked on and aspects of access control for XML will be dealt with.Within the fifth module, the concept of transaction explained in previous topics will be deepened. Based on this concept, a distinction will be made between ACID and BASE transactions. Multilevel reservations, the multiversion mechanism and time stamping will be explained. The first two mechanisms have been chosen for their wide use in commercial DBMSs, while the last one has been chosen for its wide use in distributed environments.The sixth module introduces concepts related to data recovery, which in turn are related to transactions.Finally, in the seventh module, concepts related to query optimization in distributed environments will be explained. First of all, we will analyze the syntactic optimization to continue working with the physical optimization. The concepts of intra and interparallelism will also be worked on.

124,Computational thinking,"<h2>title</h2>Computational thinking<h2>summary</h2>This course is designed to prepare us to start in the world of programming, and to know and understand the basic concepts that will allow us to turn a specific problem into a small program that solves it.In order to do so, we will first learn to think in such a way that we can identify what kinds of problems can be solved using a computer running through a sequence of steps designed to solve the proposed problem. That is, through what is known as computational thinking, we will know the abstract concepts that determine the appropriate reasoning to be able to solve problems through programs.Next, we'll review programming languages, which have evolved very rapidly since the popularization of personal computers, and we'll also learn about other important elements of programming context and vocabulary, such as what a computer is and what its function is. basic function. .Finally, we will see how to put it into practice by developing a small program in a guided way, introducing the different concepts that make up what is known as structured programming. To do this, we will use the Processing programming language, which was created with the aim of encouraging creativity and learning to program in a simple and attractive way.<h2>content</h2>The contents of the course are grouped into two blocks:Computational thinking, or how we should think to solve a problem using a computer.
