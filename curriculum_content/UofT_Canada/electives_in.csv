CSC301H5,Introduction to Software Engineering,An introduction to agile development methods appropriate for medium-sized teams and rapidly-moving projects. Basic software development infrastructure; requirements elicitation and tracking; estimation and prioritization; teamwork skills; basic UML; design patterns and refactoring; security.
CSC309H5,Programming on the Web,"An introduction to software development on the web. Concepts underlying the development of programs that operate on the web; survey of technological alternatives; greater depth on some technologies. Operational concepts of the internet and the web, static client content, dynamic client content, dynamically served content, n-tiered architectures, web development processes, and security on the web. Assignments involve increasingly more complex web-based programs."
CSC311H5,Introduction to Machine Learning,"An introduction to methods for automated learning of relationships on the basis of empirical data. Classification and regression using nearest neighbour methods, decision trees, linear models, and neural networks. Clustering algorithms. Problems of overfitting and of assessing accuracy. Basics of reinforcement learning."
CSC324H5,Principles of Programming Languages,"Major topics in the development of modern programming languages. Syntax specification, type systems, type inference, exception handling, information hiding, structural recursion, run-time storage management, and programming paradigms. Two non-procedural programming paradigms: functional programming (illustrated by languages such as Lisp, Scheme, ML or Haskell) and logic programming (illustrated by languages such as Prolog, XSB or Coral)."
CSC338H5,Numerical Methods,"Computational methods for solving numerical problems in science, engineering and business. Linear and non-linear equations, approximation, optimization, interpolation, integration and differentiation. The aim is to give students a basic understanding of floating-point arithmetic and the implementation of algorithms used to solve numerical problems, as well as a familiarity with current numerical computing environments.Course concepts are crucial to a wide range of practical applications such as computational finance and portfolio management, graphics and special effects, data mining and machine learning, as well as robotics, bioinformatics, medical imaging and others."
CSC347H5,Introduction to Information Security,"An investigation of many aspects of modern information security. Major topics cover: Techniques to identify and avoid common software development flaws which leave software vulnerable to crackers. Utilizing modern operating systems security features to deploy software in a protected environment. Common threats to networks and networked computers and tools to deal with them. Cryptography and the role it plays in software development, systems security and network security."
CSC367H5,Parallel Programming,"Introduction to aspects of parallel programming. Topics include computer instruction execution, instruction-level parallelism, memory system performance, task and data parallelism, parallel models (shared memory, message passing), synchronization, scalability and Amdahl's law, Flynn taxonomy, vector processing and parallel computing architectures."
CSC375H5,Algorithmic Intelligence in Robotics,"Robots of the future will need to operate autonomously in unstructured and unseen environments. It is imperative that these systems are built on intelligent and adaptive algorithms. This course will introduce fundamental algorithmic approaches for building an intelligent robot system that can autonomously operate in unstructured environments such as homes and warehouses. This course introduces the broad philosophy of “Sense-Plan-Act”, and covers algorithms in each of these areas -- how should the robot perceive the world, how to make long term decisions and how to perform closed-loop control of articulated robots."
CSC376H5,Fundamentals of Robotics,"An introduction to robotics covering basic methodologies, tools, and concepts to build a foundation for advanced topics in robotics. The course covers robot manipulators; kinematics; motion planning; and control. Topics covered in lecture will be implemented and explored in a practical environment using robots from different application domains."
CSC384H5,Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,"Theories and algorithms that capture (or approximate) some of the core elements of computational intelligence. Topics include: search, logical representations and reasoning, classical automated planning, representing and reasoning with uncertainty, learning, decision making (planning) under uncertainty. Assignments provide practical experience, in both theory and programming, of the core topics."
CSC413H5,Neural Networks and Deep Learning,An introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Backpropagation and automatic differentiation. Architectures: convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks. Methods for improving optimization and generalization. Neural networks for unsupervised and reinforcement learning.
CSC488H5,Compilers and Interpreters,"Compiler organization, compiler writing tools, use of regular expressions, finite automata and content-free grammars, scanning and parsing, runtime organization, semantic analysis, implementing the runtime model, storage allocation, code generation."
