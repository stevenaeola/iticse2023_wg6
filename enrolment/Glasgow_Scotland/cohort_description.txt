Ethics status:
Unofficial email confirmation from our local head of ethics and our university-level data protection team that the request is business as usual, still awaiting formal confirmation from ethics board just to be safe

Students included:

Anyone enrolled on one of our Honours-level (H-level) CS modules. Due to the structure of our institution, there are *very* few ways that that anyone enrolled on these modules will not be studying CS or a related degree as a major. H-level modules are available to 3rd and 4th year students in CS to make up 120 credits per year:
 - 3rd year:
    - 5 core modules (50 credits)
    - 1 compulsory team project (30 credits)
    - 4 electives (40 credits)
 - 4th Year:
    - 1 core module (10 credits)
    - 1 compulsory individual project (40 credits)
    - 7 elective modules (70 credits)
    
All elective modules can be taken in either 3rd or 4th year and are all at the same level (SCQF Level 10, COMPSCI4*).

Students taking CS modules will be majoring in one of the following degrees:
 - Computer Science (BSc or MSci)
 - Software Engineering (BSc or MSci)
 - Electronic & Software Engineering (BSc, BEng or MSci)
 - Computer Science with Combined Honours (BSc or MSci)

(Note that MSci is NOT a postgraduate award; these are not students taking a Masters at the university being involved in undergrad courses. MSci is an undergradaute Masters: a 5-year programme with an extra year for either placement (in SE) or a research year (CS). When taking the COMPSCI4* electives, they will still be in their undergraduate 3rd or 4th year, but may have a bit longer to go before they get their award.)
